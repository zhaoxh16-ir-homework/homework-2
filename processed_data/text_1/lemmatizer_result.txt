but they do not show it and they speak politely about the current and the they have their at and the steady good weather and of what they have see
the successful of that day be already in and have their marlin out and carry them laid full length across two with two men stagger at the end of each plank to the fish house where they for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
those who have catch have take them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they be on a block and tackle their remove their cut off and their skin out and their flesh cut into for salt
when the wind be in the east a smell come across the harbour from the shark factory but today there be only the faint edge of the because the wind have back into the north and then off and it be pleasant and sunny on the terrace

how old be i when you first take me in a boat
five and you nearly be when i bring the fish in too green and he nearly tear the boat to
can you remember
i can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing
i can remember you throw me into the bow where the wet coil be and feel the whole boat shiver and the noise of you club him like chop a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me
can you really remember that or do i just tell it to you
i remember everything from when we first go together
the old man at him with his confident loving

he be too simple to wonder when he have humility
but he know he have it and he know it be not disgraceful and it carry no loss of true pride
tomorrow be go to be a good day with this current he say

they pick up the gear from the boat
the old man carry the mast on his shoulder and the boy carry the wooden box with the coiled brown the gaff and the harpoon with it shaft
the box with the be under the stern of the skiff along with the club that be use to subdue the big fish when they be bring alongside
no one would steal from the old man but it be well to take the sail and the heavy home a the dew be bad for them and though he be quite sure no local people would steal from him the old man think that a gaff and a harpoon be needless to leave in a boat
they up the road together to the old man shack and go in through it open door
the old man the mast with it wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it
the mast be nearly as long a the one room of the shack
the shack be make of the tough of the royal palm which be and in it there be a bed a table one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal

the boy go out
they have eat with no light on the table and the old man take off his trouser and go to bed in the dark
he roll his trouser up to make a pillow the newspaper inside them
he roll himself in the blanket and slept on the other old that cover the of the bed
he be asleep in a short time and he of when he be a boy and the long golden and the white so white they hurt your and the high cape and the great brown
he live along that coast now every night and in his he the surf roar and saw the native come rid through it
he smell the tar and oakum of the deck a he sleep and he smell the smell of that the land breeze bring at morning
usually when he smell the land breeze he wake up and dress to go and wake the boy
but tonight the smell of the land breeze come very early and he know it be too early in his dream and go on to see the white of the rise from the sea and then he of the different and of the canary
he no long of nor of nor of great nor of great fish nor nor of strength nor of his wife
he only of now and of the on the beach
they like young in the dusk and he them a he the boy
he never about the boy
he simply wake out the open door at the moon and unroll his trouser and put them on
he outside the shack and then go up the road to wake the boy
he be shiver with the morning cold
but he know he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be row
the door of the house where the boy live be unlocked and he it and in quietly with his bare
the boy be asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that come in from the die moon
he take hold of one foot gently and it until the boy woke and turn and at him
the old man and the boy take his trouser from the chair by the bed and sit on the bed them on
the old man go out the door and the boy come after him
he be sleepy and the old man put his arm across his and say i be sorry
the boy say
it be what a man must do
they down the road to the old man shack and all along the road in the dark barefoot men be move carry the of their
when they the old man shack the boy take the of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carry the mast with the sail on his shoulder
do you want coffee

we put the gear in the boat and then get some
they have coffee from condense milk at an early morning place that
how do you sleep old man
the boy

he off on the coral to the ice house where the be
the old man drink his coffee slowly
it be all he would have all day and he know that he should take it
for a long time now eat have him and he never carry a lunch
he have a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that be all he for the day
the boy be back now with the and the two wrap in a newspaper and they go down the trail to the skiff feel the pebbled sand under their and the skiff and slide her into the water
good luck old man
good luck the old man say
he fit the rope of the onto the thole and lean forward against the thrust of the in the water he to row out of the harbour in the dark
there be other from the other go out to sea and the old man the dip and push of their even though he could not see them now the moon be below the
sometimes someone would speak in a boat
but most of the be silent except for the dip of the
they spread apart after they be out of the mouth of the harbour and each one head for the part of the ocean where he hop to find fish
the old man know he be go far out and he leave the smell of the land behind and row out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean
he saw the phosphorescence of the gulf weed in the water a he row over the part of the ocean that the the great well because there be a sudden deep of seven hundred where all of fish because of the swirl the current make against the steep of the floor of the ocean
here there be of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes of squid in the and these rise close to the surface at night where all the wander fish feed on them
in the dark the old man could feel the morning come and a he row he the tremble sound a fly fish leave the water and the hissing that their stiff set make a they away in the darkness
he be very of fly fish a they be his principal on the ocean
he be sorry for the especially the small delicate dark that be always fly and look and almost never finding and he think the have a hard life than we do except for the robber and the heavy strong
why do they make so delicate and fine a those sea when the ocean can be so cruel
she be kind and very beautiful
but she can be so cruel and it come so suddenly and such that fly dip and hunt with their small sad be make too delicately for the sea
he always think of the sea a which be what people call her in when they love her
sometimes those who love her say bad of her but they be always say a though she be a woman
some of the young those who use a for their and have buy when the shark have bring much money spoke of her a which be masculine
they speak of her a a contestant or a place or even an enemy
but the old man always think of her a feminine and a something that give or withheld great and if she do wild or wicked it be because she could not help them
the moon her a it do a woman he think
he be row steadily and it be no effort for him since he keep well within his speed and the surface of the ocean be flat except for the occasional of the current
he be the current do a third of the work and a it to be light he saw he be already far out than he have hop to be at this hour
i work the deep for a week and do nothing he think
today i work out where the of and albacore be and maybe there will be a big one with them
before it be really light he have his out and be drift with the current
one bait be down forty
the second be at and the third and fourth be down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and
each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish tie and sew solid and all the project part of the hook the curve and the point be cover with fresh
each sardine be hook through both so that they make a on the projecting steel
there be no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which be not sweet smelling and good tasting
the boy have give him two fresh small or which hung on the two like and on the he have a big blue runner and a yellow jack that have be use before but they be in good condition still and have the excellent to give them scent and attractiveness
each line a thick around a a big pencil be onto a stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line have two which could be make fast to the other spare so that if it be necessary a fish could take out over three hundred of line
now the man watch the dip of the three stick over the side of the skiff and row gently to keep the straight up and down and at their proper
it be quite light and any moment now the sun would rise
the sun rise thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other low on the water and well in toward the shore spread out across the current
then the sun be and the glare come on the water and then a it rise clear the flat sea send it back at his so that it hurt sharply and he row without look into it
he down into the water and watch the that go straight down into the dark of the water
he keep them than anyone do so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait wait exactly where he wish it to be for any fish that swam there
let them drift with the current and sometimes they be at sixty when the thought they be at a hundred
but he think i keep them with precision
only i have no luck any more
but who
maybe today
every day be a new day
it be well to be lucky
but i would rather be exact
then when luck come you be ready
the sun be two high now and it do not hurt his so much to look into the east
there be only three in sight now and they very low and far inshore
all my life the early sun hurt my he think
yet they be still good
in the evening i can look straight into it without get the blackness
it more force in the evening too
but in the morning it be painful
just then he saw a bird with his long black circling in the sky ahead of him
he make a quick drop slant down on his and then circle again
he get something the old man say aloud
he not just look
he row slowly and steadily toward where the bird be circle
he do not hurry and he keep his straight up and down
but he crowd the current a little so that he be still fish correctly though fast than he would have fish if he be not try to use the bird
the bird go high in the air and circle again his motionless
then he dive suddenly and the old man saw fly fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface
dolphin the old man say aloud
big dolphin
he ship his and bring a small line from under the bow
it have a wire leader and a hook and he it with one of the
he let it go over the side and then make it fast to a ring bolt in the stern
then he another line and leave it coil in the shade of the bow
he go back to rowing and to watch the black bird who be work now low over the water
a he watch the bird dip again slant his for the dive and then swing them wildly and ineffectually a he the fly fish
the old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raise a they the fish
the dolphin be cut through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the fish
it be a big school of dolphin he think
they be wide spread and the fly fish have little chance
the bird no chance
the fly fish be too big for him and they go too fast
he watch the fly fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual of the bird
that school get away from me he think
they be move out too fast and too far
but perhaps i will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish be around them
my big fish must be somewhere
the over the land now rise like and the coast be only a long green line with the gray blue behind it
the water be a dark blue now so dark that it be almost purple
a he down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun make now
he watch his to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he be happy to see so much plankton because it mean fish
the strange light the sun make in the water now that the sun be higher meant good weather and so do the shape of the over the land
but the bird be almost out of sight now and nothing on the surface of the water but some of yellow sargasso weed and the purple iridescent gelatinous bladder of a float close beside the boat
it turn on it side and then itself
it cheerfully a a bubble with it long deadly purple trail a yard behind it in the water
the man say
you whore
from where he swing lightly against his he down into the water and saw the tiny fish that be like the trailing and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble make a it
they be immune to it poison
but men be not and when some of the would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man be work a fish he would have and on his arm and of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give
but these from the come quickly and strike like a whiplash
the iridescent be beautiful
but they be the thing in the sea and the old man to see the big sea eat them
the saw them them from the front then shut their so they be completely carapaced and eat them and all
the old man to see the eat them and he to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he step on them with the horny sol of his
he green and with their elegance and speed and their great value and he have a friendly contempt for the huge stupid yellow in their strange in their and happily eat the with their shut
he have no mysticism about although he have go in turtle for many
he be sorry for them all even the great trunk that be as long a the skiff and weigh a ton
most people be heartless about because a turtle heart will beat for after he be cut up and
but the old man think i have such a heart too and my and be like theirs
he eat the white to give himself strength
he eat them all through may to be strong in and for the truly big fish
he also drink a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the kept their gear
it be there for all who it
most the taste
but it be no bad than get up at the that they rise and it be very good against all and and it be good for the
now the old man up and saw that the bird be circle again
he find fish he say aloud
no fly fish break the surface and there be no scattering of bait fish
but a the old man watch a small tuna rise in the air turn and head first into the water
the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he have back into the water another and another rise and they be in all churn the water and leaping in long after the bait
they be circle it and drive it
if they do travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watch the school work the water white and the bird now drop and dip into the bait fish that be force to the surface in their panic
the bird be a great help the old man say
just then the stern line come taut under his foot where he have keep a loop of the line and he his and felt the weight of the small tuna shiver pull a he the line firm and to haul it in
the shivering a he in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his side before he swing him over the side and into the boat
he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shape his big unintelligent staring a he his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering of his neat tail
the old man hit him on the head for kindness and him his body still under the shade of the stern
albacore he say aloud
he make a beautiful bait
he weigh ten
he do not remember when he have first to talk aloud when he be by himself
he have sung when he be by himself in the old day and he have sing at night sometimes when he be alone steer on his watch in the or in the turtle
he have probably to talk aloud when alone when the boy have leave
but he do not remember
when he and the boy fish together they usually speak only when it be necessary
they at night or when they be by bad weather
it be consider a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man have always consider it so and it
but now he say his aloud many time since there be no one that they could annoy
if the me talk out loud they would think that i be crazy he say aloud
but since i be not crazy i do not care
and the rich have to talk to them in their and to bring them the baseball
now be no time to think of baseball he think
now be the time to think of only one thing
that which i be bear for
there might be a big one around that school he think
i pick up only a straggler from the albacore that be feed
but they be work far out and fast
everything that on the surface today very fast and to the
can that be the time of day
or be it some sign of weather that i do not know
he could not see the green of the shore now but only the top of the blue that white a though they be and the that like high snow above them
the sea be very dark and the light make in the water
the myriad of the plankton be now by the high sun and it be only the great deep in the blue water that the old man saw now with his go straight down into the water that be a mile deep
the tuna the all the fish of that specie tuna and only distinguish among them by their proper when they come to sell them or to trade them for be down again
the sun be hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back a he row
i could just drift he think and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me
but today be day and i should fish the day well
just then watch his he saw one of the project green stick dip sharply
yes he say
yes and ship his without bump the boat
he out for the line and it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand
he felt no strain nor weight and he the line lightly
then it come again
this time it be a tentative pull not solid nor heavy and he know exactly what it be
one hundred down a marlin be eat the that cover the point and the shank of the hook where the hook from the head of the small tuna
the old man the line delicately and softly with his left hand unleash it from the stick
now he could let it run through his without the fish feeling any tension
this far out he must be huge in this month he think
eat them fish
eat them
please eat them
how fresh they be and you down there six hundred in that cold water in the dark
make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them
he felt the light delicate and then a harder pull when a sardine head must have be more difficult to break from the hook
then there be nothing
come on the old man say aloud
make another turn
just smell them
be they lovely
eat them good now and then there be the tuna
hard and cold and lovely
do be shy fish
eat them
he with the line between his thumb and his finger watch it and the other at the same time for the fish might have swim up or down
then come the same delicate touch again
he take it the old man say aloud
god help him to take it
he do not take it though
he be go and the old man felt nothing
he ca have go he say
he ca have go
make a turn
maybe he be hook before and he something of it
then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he be happy
it be only his turn he say
he take it
he be happy feel the gentle and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy
it be the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unroll off the first of the two reserve
a it go down slip lightly through the old he still could feel the great weight though the pressure of his thumb and finger be almost imperceptible
what a fish he say
he it sideways in his mouth now and he be move off with it
then he will turn and swallow it he think
he do not say that because he know that if you say a good thing it might not happen
he know what a huge fish this be and he think of him move away in the darkness with the tuna crosswise in his mouth
at that moment he felt him stop move but the weight be still there
then the weight and he give more line
he the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight and be go straight down
he take it he say
now i let him eat it well
he let the line slip through his while he down with his left hand and make fast the free end of the two reserve to the loop of the two reserve of the next line
now he be ready
he have three of line in reserve now as well a the coil he be
eat it a little more he say
eat it well
eat it so that the point of the hook go into your heart and you he think
come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you
all right
be you ready
have you be long enough at table
now
he say aloud and struck hard with both a yard of line and then strike again and again swing with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arm and the weight of his body
nothing
the fish just away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch
his line be strong and make for heavy fish and he it against his back until it be so taut that of water be from it
then it to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still it brace himself against the thwart and lean back against the pull
the boat to move slowly off toward the
the fish steadily and they travel slowly on the calm water
the other be still in the water but there be nothing to be do
i wish i have the boy the old man say aloud
i be by a fish and i the towing bitt
i could make the line fast
but then he could break it
i must hold him all i can and give him line when he must have it
thank god he be and not go down
what i will do if he to go down i do know
what i do if he and i do know
but i do something
there be plenty of i can do
he the line against his back and watch it slant in the water and the skiff move steadily to the
this will kill him the old man think
he ca do this forever
but four later the fish be still swim steadily out to sea tow the skiff and the old man be still brace solidly with the line across his back
it be noon when i hook him he say
and i have never see him
he have his straw hat hard down on his head before he hook the fish and it be cut his forehead
he be thirsty too and he get down on his and be careful not to jerk on the line a far into the bow a he could get and the water bottle with one hand
he it and drink a little
then he against the bow
he sit on the mast and sail and try not to think but only to endure
then he behind him and saw that no land be visible
that no difference he think
i can always come in on the glow from
there be two more before the sun and maybe he will come up before that
if he do maybe he will come up with the moon
if he do not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise
i have no and i feel strong
it be he that the hook in his mouth
but what a fish to pull like that
he must have his mouth shut tight on the wire
i wish i could see him
i wish i could see him only once to know what i have against me
the fish never his course nor his direction all that night as far a the man could tell from watch the
it be cold after the sun go down and the old man sweat dry cold on his back and his arm and his old
during the day he have take the sack that cover the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry
after the sun go down he tie it around his neck so that it down over his back and he cautiously work it down under the line that be across his now
the sack cushion the line and he have find a way of lean forward against the bow so that he be almost comfortable
the position actually be only somewhat less intolerable but he think of it a almost comfortable
i can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me he think
not as long a he this up
once he stand up and over the side of the skiff and at the and check his course
the line like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his
they be move more slowly now and the glow of be not so strong so that he know the current must be carry them to the eastward
if i lose the glare of we must be go more to the eastward he think
for if the fish course true i must see it for many more
i wonder how the baseball come out in the grand today he think
it would be wonderful to do this with a radio
then he think think of it always
think of what you be do
you must do nothing stupid
then he say aloud i wish i have the boy
to help me and to see this
no one should be alone in their old age he think
but it be unavoidable
i must remember to eat the tuna before he in order to keep strong
remember no matter how little you want to that you must eat him in the morning
remember he say to himself
during the night two porpoise come around the boat and he could hear them roll and blow
he could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male make and the sigh blow of the female
they be good he say
they play and make and love one another
they be our like the fly fish
then he to pity the great fish that he have hook
he be wonderful and strange and who how old he be he think
never have i have such a strong fish nor one who so strangely
perhaps he be too wise to jump
he could ruin me by or by a wild rush
but perhaps he be hook many time before and he that this be how he should make his fight
he can not know that it be only one man against him nor that it be an old man
but what a great fish he be and what he will bring in the market if the flesh be good
he take the bait like a male and he like a male and his fight no panic in it
i wonder if he any or if he be just as desperate a i be
he the time he have hook one of a pair of marlin
the male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish the female make a wild despair fight that soon exhaust her and all the time the male have stay with her cross the line and circle with her on the surface
he have stay so close that the old man be afraid he would cut the line with his tail which be sharp a a scythe and almost of that size and shape
when the old man have her and club her hold the rapier bill with it sandpaper edge and club her across the top of her head until her colour turn to a colour almost like the backing of and then with the boy aid her aboard the male fish have stay by the side of the boat
then while the old man be clear the and the harpoon the male fish high into the air beside the boat to see where the female be and then go down deep his lavender that be his pectoral spread wide and all his wide lavender show
he be beautiful the old man and he have stay
that be the thing i ever saw with them the old man think
the boy be sad too and we her pardon and her promptly
i wish the boy be here he say aloud and settle himself against the rounded of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he across his move steadily toward whatever he have choose
when once through my treachery it have be necessary to him to make a choice the old man think
his choice have be to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all and trap and
my choice be to go there to find him beyond all people
beyond all people in the world
now we be together and have be since noon
and no one to help either one of u
perhaps i should not have be a fisherman he think
but that be the thing that i be bear for
i must surely remember to eat the tuna after it light
some time before daylight something take one of the that be behind him
he the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff
in the darkness he his sheath knife and take all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale
then he cut the other line to him and in the dark make the loose of the reserve fast
he work skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the to hold them a he draw his tight
now he have six reserve of line
there be two from each bait he have and the two from the bait the fish have take and they be all connect
after it be light he think i will work back to the bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve
i will have lose two hundred of good and the and
that can be
but who this fish if i hook some fish and it him off
i do know what that fish be that take the bait just now
it could have be a marlin or a broadbill or a shark
i never felt him
i have to get rid of him too fast
aloud he say i wish i have the boy
but you have get the boy he think
you have only yourself and you have good work back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve
so he do it
it be difficult in the dark and once the fish make a surge that him down on his face and make a cut below his eye
the blood run down his cheek a little way
but it and dry before it his chin and he work his way back to the bow and against the wood
he the sack and carefully work the line so that it come across a new part of his and hold it anchor with his he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water
i wonder what he make that lurch for he think
the wire must have slip on the great hill of his back
certainly his back can not feel as badly a mine do
but he can not pull this skiff forever no matter how great he be
now everything be away that might make trouble and i have a big reserve of line all that a man can ask
fish he say softly aloud i stay with you until i be dead
he stay with me too i suppose the old man thought and he for it to be light
it be cold now in the time before daylight and he against the wood to be warm
i can do it as long a he can he think
and in the first light the line extend out and down into the water
the boat steadily and when the first edge of the sun rise it be on the old man right shoulder
he head north the old man say
the current will have set u far to the eastward he think
i wish he would turn with the current
that would show that he be tire
when the sun have rise far the old man that the fish be not tire
there be only one favorable sign
the slant of the line he be swim at a less depth
that do not necessarily mean that he would jump
but he might
god let him jump the old man say
i have enough line to handle him
maybe if i can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump he think
now that it be daylight let him jump so that he fill the along his backbone with air and then he can not go deep to die
he try to increase the tension but the line have be taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he have hook the fish and he felt the harshness a he back to pull and know he could put no more strain on it
i must not jerk it ever he think
each jerk the cut the hook and then when he do jump he might throw it
anyway i feel well with the sun and for once i do not have to look into it
there be yellow weed on the line but the old man know that only make an added drag and he be
it be the yellow gulf weed that have make so much phosphorescence in the night
fish he say i love you and respect you very much
but i will kill you dead before this day
let u hope so he think
a small bird come toward the skiff from the north
he be a warbler and fly very low over the water
the old man could see that he be very tired
the bird make the stern of the boat and there
then he fly around the old man head and on the line where he be more comfortable
how old be you
the old man the bird
be this your first trip
the bird at him when he speak
he be too tired even to examine the line and he on it a his delicate it fast
it steady the old man tell him
it too steady
you be that tired after a windless night
what be come to
the he think that come out to sea to meet them
but he say nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the soon enough
take a good rest small bird he say
then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish
it him to talk because his back have in the night and it hurt truly now
stay at my house if you like bird he say
i be sorry i can not hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that be rise
but i be with a friend
just then the fish give a sudden lurch that the old man down onto the bow and would have him overboard if he have not brace himself and give some line
the bird have fly up when the line and the old man have not even see him go
he felt the line carefully with his right hand and his hand be bleed
something hurt him then he say aloud and back on the line to see if he could turn the fish
but when he be touch the breaking point he steady and settle back against the strain of the line
you feel it now fish he say
and so god be i
he around for the bird now because he would have him for company
the bird be go
you do not stay long the man think
but it be rougher where you be go until you make the shore
how do i let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he make
i must be get very stupid
or perhaps i be look at the small bird and thinking of him
now i will pay attention to my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failure of strength
i wish the boy be here and that i have some salt he say aloud
shift the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneel carefully he wash his hand in the ocean and it there submerge for more than a minute watch the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand a the boat
he much he say
the old man would have to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he be afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stand up and brace himself and his hand up against the sun
it be only a line burn that have cut his flesh
but it be in the working part of his hand
he know he would need his before this be over and he do not like to be cut before it
now he say when his hand have dry i must eat the small tuna
i can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort
he kneel down and find the tuna under the stern with the gaff and draw it toward him keep it clear of the coiled
hold the line with his left shoulder again and brace on his left hand and arm he take the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place
he put one knee on the fish and cut of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail
they be and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly
when he have cut six he spread them out on the wood of the bow his knife on his trouser and the carcass of the bonito by the tail and it overboard
i do think i can eat an entire one he say and draw his knife across one of the
he could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand be cramp
it draw up tight on the heavy cord and he at it in disgust
what kind of a hand be that he say
cramp then if you want
make yourself into a claw
it will do you no good
come on he think and down into the dark water at the slant of the line
eat it now and it will strengthen the hand
it be not the hand fault and you have be many with the fish
but you can stay with him forever
eat the bonito now
he pick up a piece and put it in his mouth and it slowly
it be not unpleasant
chew it well he think and get all the
it would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt
how do you feel hand
he the cramped hand that be almost as stiff a rigor
i eat some more for you
he eat the other part of the piece that he have cut in two
he it carefully and then spat out the skin
how do it go hand
or be it too early to know
he take another full piece and it
it be a strong fish he think
i be lucky to get him instead of dolphin
dolphin be too sweet
this be hardly sweet at all and all the strength be still in it
there be no sense in be anything but practical though he think
i wish i have some salt
and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what be leave so i have well eat it all although i be not hungry
the fish be calm and steady
i will eat it all and then i will be ready
be patient hand he say
i do this for you
i wish i could fee the fish he think
he be my brother
but i must kill him and keep strong to do it
slowly and conscientiously he eat all of the of fish
he up his hand on his trouser
now he say
you can let the cord go hand and i will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense
he put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand have and lay back against the pull against his back
god help me to have the cramp go he say
because i do not know what the fish be go to do
but he calm he think and follow his plan
but what be his plan he think
and what be mine
mine i must improvise to his because of his great size
if he will jump i can kill him
but he stay down forever
then i will stay down with him forever
he rub the cramped hand against his trouser and try to gentle the
but it would not open
maybe it will open with the sun he think
maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna be digest
if i have to have it i will open it cost whatever it
but i do not want to open it now by force
let it open by itself and come back of it own accord
after all i it much in the night when it be necessary to free and unite the various
he across the sea and know how alone he be now
but he could see the in the deep dark water and the line ahead and the strange undulation of the calm
the be build up now for the trade wind and he ahead and saw a flight of wild etch themselves against the sky over the water then then etch again and he know no man be ever alone on the sea
he think of how some men fear be out of sight of land in a small boat and know they be right in the of sudden bad weather
but now they be in hurricane and when there be no the weather of hurricane be the best of all the year
if there be a hurricane you always see the of it in the sky for day ahead if you be at sea
they do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for he think
the land must make a difference too in the shape of the
but we have no hurricane come now
he at the sky and saw the white cumulus build like friendly pile of ice cream and high above be the thin of the cirrus against the high sky
light he say
well weather for me than for you fish
his left hand be still cramp but he be it slowly
i hate a cramp he think
it be a treachery of one own body
it be humiliate before to have a from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it
but a cramp he think of it a a oneself especially when one be alone
if the boy be here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he think
but it will loosen up
then with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water
then a he against the line and his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slant slowly upward
he come up he say
come on hand
please come on
the line rise slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean ahead of the boat and the fish come out
he come out unendingly and water from his side
he be bright in the sun and his head and back be dark purple and in the sun the on his side wide and a light lavender
his sword be as long a a baseball bat and taper like a rapier and he rise his full length from the water and then it smoothly like a diver and the old man saw the great of his tail go under and the line to race out
he be two long than the skiff the old man say
the line be go out fast but steadily and the fish be not panic
the old man be try with both to keep the line just inside of break strength
he know that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it
he be a great fish and i must convince him he think
i must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he make his run
if i be him i would put in everything now and go until something break
but thank god they be not as intelligent a we who kill them although they be more noble and more able
the old man have see many great fish
he have see many that weigh more than a thousand and he have catch two of that size in his life but never alone
now alone and out of sight of land he be fast to the big fish that he have ever see and big than he have ever of and his left hand be still as tight a the of an eagle
it will uncramp though he think
surely it will uncramp to help my right hand
there be three that be the fish and my two
it must uncramp
it be unworthy of it to be cramp
the fish have again and be go at his usual pace
i wonder why he the old man think
he almost a though to show me how big he be
i know now anyway he think
i wish i could show him what sort of man i be
but then he would see the cramped hand
let him think i be more man than i be and i will be so
i wish i be the fish he think with everything he against only my will and my intelligence
he settle comfortably against the wood and take his suffering a it come and the fish swam steadily and the boat slowly through the dark water
there be a small sea rise with the wind come up from the east and at noon the old man leave hand be uncramped
bad news for you fish he say and the line over the that cover his
he be comfortable but suffer although he do not admit the suffering at all
i be not religious he say
but i will say ten our and ten hail that i should catch this fish and i promise to make a pilgrimage to the de if i catch him
that be a promise
he to say his mechanically
sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically
hail be easy to say than our he think
hail mary full of grace the lord be with thee
bless art thou among and bless be the fruit of thy womb
holy mary mother of god pray for u now and at the hour of our death
amen
then he add bless virgin pray for the death of this fish
wonderful though he be
with his say and feel much well but suffer exactly as much and perhaps a little more he against the wood of the bow and mechanically to work the of his left hand
the sun be hot now although the breeze be rise gently
i have well that little line out over the stern he say
if the fish to stay another night i will need to eat again and the water be low in the bottle
i do think i can get anything but a dolphin here
but if i eat him fresh enough he wo be bad
i wish a fly fish would come on board tonight
but i have no light to attract them
a fly fish be excellent to eat raw and i would not have to cut him up
i must save all my strength now
i do not know he be so big
i kill him though he say
in all his greatness and his glory
although it be unjust he think
but i will show him what a man can do and what a man
i tell the boy i be a strange old man he say
now be when i must prove it
the thousand time that he have prove it mean nothing
now he be prove it again
each time be a new time and he never think about the past when he be do it
i wish he sleep and i could sleep and dream about the he think
why be the the main thing that be leave
do think old man he say to himself
rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing
he be work
work as little a you can
it be get into the afternoon and the boat still slowly and steadily
but there be an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man ride gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back come to him easily and smoothly
once in the afternoon the line to rise again
but the fish only continue to swim at a slightly high level
the sun be on the old man leave arm and shoulder and on his back
so he know the fish have turn east of north
now that he have see him once he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral set wide a and the great erect tail slice through the dark
i wonder how much he at that depth the old man think
his eye be huge and a horse with much less eye can see in the dark
once i could see quite well in the dark
not in the absolute dark
but almost a a cat
the sun and his steady movement of his have uncramped his left hand now completely and he to shift more of the strain to it and he the of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little
if you not tire fish he say aloud you must be very strange
he felt very tire now and he know the night would come soon and he try to think of other
he think of the big to him they be the and he know that the of new york be the of
this be the second day now that i do not know the result of the he think
but i must have confidence and i must be worthy of the great who do all perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel
what be a bone spur
he himself
de
we do not have them
can it be as painful a the spur of a fight cock in one heel
i do not think i could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both and continue to fight a the fighting do
man be not much beside the great and
still i would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea
unless come he say aloud
if come god pity him and me
do you believe the great would stay with a fish as long a i will stay with this one
he think
i be sure he would and more since he be young and strong
also his father be a fisherman
but would the bone spur hurt him too much
i do not know he say aloud
i never have a bone spur
a the sun set he to give himself more confidence the time in the tavern at when he have the hand game with the great negro from who be the man on the
they have go one day and one night with their on a chalk line on the table and their straight up and their tight
each one be try to force the other hand down onto the table
there be much betting and people go in and out of the room under the kerosene and he have at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro face
they the every four after the first eight so that the could sleep
blood come out from under the of both his and the negro and they each other in the eye and at their and and the go in and out of the room and sat on high against the wall and watch
the be paint bright blue and be of wood and the threw their against them
the negro shadow be huge and it on the wall a the breeze the
the odds would change back and forth all night and they feed the negro rum and for him
then the negro after the rum would try for a tremendous effort and once he have the old man who be not an old man then but be el nearly three off balance
but the old man have raise his hand up to dead even again
he be sure then that he have the negro who be a fine man and a great athlete beaten
and at daylight when the be that it be a draw and the referee be shake his head he have unleash his effort and force the hand of the negro down and down until it on the wood
the match have on a morning and end on a morning
many of the had for a draw because they have to go to work on the loading of sugar or at the coal company
otherwise everyone would have it to go to a finish
but he have finish it anyway and before anyone have to go to work
for a long time after that everyone have him the champion and there have be a return match in the spring
but not much money be bet and he have win it quite easily since he have break the confidence of the negro from in the first match
after that he have a few and then no more
he decide that he could beat anyone if he to badly enough and he decide that it be bad for his right hand for fishing
he have try a few practice with his left hand
but his left hand have always be a traitor and would not do what he on it to do and he do not trust it
the sun will bake it out well now he think
it should not cramp on me again unless it too cold in the night
i wonder what this night will bring
an airplane over head on it course to and he watch it shadow up the of fly fish
with so much fly fish there should be dolphin he say and back on the line to see if it be possible to gain any on his fish
but he could not and it stay at the hardness and shivering that break
the boat ahead slowly and he watch the airplane until he could no longer see it
it must be very strange in an airplane he think
i wonder what the sea like from that height
they should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high
i would like to fly very slowly at two hundred high and see the fish from above
in the turtle i be in the of the and even at that height i saw much
the dolphin look greener from there and you can see their and their purple and you can see all of the school a they swim
why be it that all the fish of the dark current have purple and usually purple or
the dolphin green of course because he be really golden
but when he come to fee truly hungry purple show on his side a on a marlin
can it be anger or the great speed he that them out
just before it be dark a they a great island of sargasso weed that and swing in the light sea a though the ocean be make love with something under a yellow blanket his small line be take by a dolphin
he saw it first when it in the air true gold in the last of the sun and bending and wildly in the air
it again and again in the acrobatics of it fear and he work his way back to the stern and crouch and hold the big line with his right hand and arm he the dolphin in with his left hand step on the line each time with his bare leave foot
when the fish be at the stern plunging and cut from side to side in desperation the old man over the stern and the gold fish with it purple over the stern
it be work convulsively in quick against the hook and it the bottom of the skiff with it long flat body it tail and it head until he club it across the shin golden head until it and be still
the old man unhook the fish the line with another sardine and it over
then he work his way slowly back to the bow
he wash his left hand and it on his trouser
then he the heavy line from his right hand to his left and wash his right hand in the sea while he watch the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord
he at all he say
but watch the movement of the water against his hand he note that it be perceptibly
i lash the two together across the stern and that will slow him in the night he say
he good for the night and so be i
it would be good to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat he think
i can do that a little later and lash the to make a drag at the same time
i have well keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset
the setting of the sun be a difficult time for all fish
he let his hand dry in the air then the line with it and himself as much a he could and himself to be forward against the wood so that the boat take the strain a much or more than he do
i learn how to do it he think
this part of it anyway
then too remember he eaten since he take the bait and he be huge and need much food
i have eat the whole bonito
tomorrow i will eat the dolphin
he it
perhaps i should eat some of it when i clean it
it will be hard to eat than the bonito
but then nothing be easy
how do you feel fish
he aloud
i feel good and my left hand be well and i have food for a night and a day
pull the boat fish
he do not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back have almost pain and go into a dullness that he
but i have have bad than that he think
my hand be only cut a little and the cramp be go from the other
my be all right
also now i have on him in the question of sustenance
it be dark now a it become dark quickly after the sun in
he lay against the worn wood of the bow and all that he could
the first be out
he do not know the name of but he saw it and know soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant
the fish be my friend too he say aloud
i have never see or of such a fish
but i must kill him
i be glad we do not have to try to kill the
imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon he think
the moon away
but imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun
we be bear lucky he think
then he be sorry for the great fish that have nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relax in his sorrow for him
how many people will he fee he think
but be they worthy to eat him
no of course not
there be no one worthy of eat him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity
i do not understand these he think
but it be good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the
it be enough to live on the sea and kill our true
now he think i must think about the drag
it it and it
i may lose so much line that i will lose him if he his effort and the drag make by the be in place and the boat all her lightness
her lightness both our suffering but it be my safety since he great speed that he never yet employ
no matter what i must gut the dolphin so he do not spoil and eat some of him to be strong
now i will rest an hour more and feel that he be solid and steady before i move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision
in the i can see how he and if he any
the be a good trick but it the time to play for safety
he be much fish still and i saw that the hook be in the corner of his mouth and he keep his mouth tight shut
the punishment of the hook be nothing
the punishment of hunger and that he be against something that he do not comprehend be everything
rest now old man and let him work until your next duty come
he for what he to be two
the moon do not rise now until late and he have no way of the time
nor be he really rest except comparatively
he be still bear the pull of the fish across his but he his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself
how simple it would be if i could make the line fast he think
but with one small lurch he could break it
i must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all time be ready to give line with both
but you have not sleep yet old man he say aloud
it be half a day and a night and now another day and you have not sleep
you must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he be quiet and steady
if you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head
i clear enough in the head he think
too clear
i be as clear a the that be my
still i must sleep
they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sometimes on certain day when there be no current and a flat calm
but remember to sleep he think
make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the
now go back and prepare the dolphin
it be too dangerous to rig the a a drag if you must sleep
i could go without sleep he tell himself
but it would be too dangerous
he to work his way back to the stern on his and be careful not to jerk against the fish
he may be half asleep himself he think
but i do not want him to rest
he must pull until he
back in the stern he turn so that his left hand the strain of the line across his and draw his knife from it sheath with his right hand
the be bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he the blade of his knife into his head and draw him out from under the stern
he put one of his on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his low jaw
then he put his knife down and him with his right hand scoop him clean and the clear
he felt the maw heavy and slippery in his and he slit it open
there be two fly fish inside
they be fresh and hard and he lay them side by side and the and the over the stern
they sink leave a trail of phosphorescence in the water
the dolphin be cold and a leprous now in the starlight and the old man skin one side of him while he his right foot on the fish head
then he turn him over and skin the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail
he slide the carcass overboard and to see if there be any swirl in the water
but there be only the light of it slow descent
he turn then and the two fly fish inside the two of fish and his knife back in it sheath he work his way slowly back to the bow
his back be bent with the weight of the line across it and he carry the fish in his right hand
back in the bow he lay the two of fish out on the wood with the fly fish beside them
after that he settle the line across his in a new place and it again with his left hand rest on the gunwale
then he over the side and wash the fly fish in the water the speed of the water against his hand
his hand be phosphorescent from skin the fish and he watch the flow of the water against it
the flow be less strong and a he rub the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff of phosphorus off and slowly astern
he be tire or he be rest the old man say
now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep
under the and with the night colder all the time he eat half of one of the dolphin and one of the fly fish and with it head cut off
what an excellent fish dolphin be to eat he say
and what a miserable fish raw
i will never go in a boat again without salt or lime
if i have brain i would have splash water on the bow all day and dry it would have make salt he think
but then i do not hook the dolphin until almost sunset
still it be a lack of preparation
but i have it all well and i be not
the sky be cloud over to the east and one after another the he know be go
it now a though he be move into a great canyon of and the wind have
there will be bad weather in three or four day he say
but not tonight and not tomorrow
rig now to get some sleep old man while the fish be calm and steady
he the line tight in his right hand and then his thigh against his right hand a he all his weight against the wood of the bow
then he the line a little low on his and brace his left hand on it
my right hand can hold it as long a it be brace he think
if it in sleep my left hand will wake me a the line go out
it be hard on the right hand
but he be use to punishment
even if i sleep twenty or a half an hour it be good
he lay forward cramp himself against the line with all of his body all his weight onto his right hand and he be asleep
he do not dream of the but instead of a vast school of that for eight or ten and it be in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they have make in the water when they
then he that he be in the village on his bed and there be a norther and he be very cold and his right arm be asleep because his head have on it instead of a pillow
after that he to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the come down onto it in the early dark and then the other come and he his chin on the wood of the where the ship lay anchor with the evening breeze and he to see if there would be more and he be happy
the moon have be up for a long time but he sleep on and the fish on steadily and the boat into the tunnel of
he wake with the jerk of his right fist come up against his face and the line burn out through his right hand
he have no feeling of his left hand but he all he could with his right and the line rush out
finally his left hand find the line and he back against the line and now it burn his back and his left hand and his left hand be take all the strain and cut badly
he back at the of line and they be feed smoothly
just then the fish make a great of the ocean and then a heavy fall
then he again and again and the boat be go fast although line be still race out and the old man be raise the strain to break point and raise it to break point again and again
he have be down tight onto the bow and his face be in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move
this be what we for he think
so now let u take it
make him pay for the line he think
make him pay for it
he could not see the fish but only the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash a he fell
the speed of the line be cut his badly but he have always know this would happen and he try to keep the cutting across the and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the
if the boy be here he would wet the of line he think
yes
if the boy be here
if the boy be here
the line go out and out and out but it be now and he be make the fish earn each inch of it
now he get his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek have crush
then he be on his and then he rise slowly to his
he be line but more slowly all the time
he work back to where he could feel with his foot the of line that he could not see
there be plenty of line still and now the fish have to pull the friction of all that new line through the water
yes he think
and now he more than a dozen time and fill the along his back with air and he can not go down deep to die where i can not bring him up
he will start circle soon and then i must work on him
i wonder what him so suddenly
could it have be hunger that make him desperate or be he frighten by something in the night
maybe he suddenly felt fear
but he be such a calm strong fish and he so fearless and so confident
it be strange
you good be fearless and confident yourself old man he say
you hold him again but you can not get line
but soon he to circle
the old man him with his left hand and his now and down and scoop up water in his right hand to get the crush dolphin flesh off of his face
he be afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength
when his face be he wash his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watch the first light come before the sunrise
he head almost east he think
that he be tired and go with the current
soon he will have to circle
then our true work
after he that his right hand have be in the water long enough he take it out and at it
it be not bad he say
and pain do not matter to a man
he take hold of the line carefully so that it do not fit into any of the fresh line and his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff
you do not do so badly for something worthless he say to his left hand
but there be a moment when i could not find you
why be i not bear with two good
he think
perhaps it be my fault in not train that one properly
but god he have enough to learn
he do not do so badly in the night though and he only cramp once
if he again let the line cut him off
when he think that he know that he be not be and he think he should chew some more of the dolphin
but i ca he tell himself
it be well to be than to lose your strength from nausea
and i know i can not keep it if i eat it since my face be in it
i will keep it for an emergency until it go bad
but it be too late to try for strength now through nourishment
you stupid he tell himself
eat the other fly fish
it be there and ready and he pick it up with his left hand and ate it the carefully and eat all of it down to the tail
it more nourishment than almost any fish he think
at least the kind of strength that i need
now i have do what i can he think
let him begin to circle and let the fight come
the sun be rise for the third time since he have put to sea when the fish to circle
he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish be circle
it be too early for that
he just felt a faint of the pressure of the line and he to pull on it gently with his right hand
it a always but just when he the point where it would break line to come in
he slip his and head from under the line and to pull in line steadily and gently
he use both of his in a swinging motion and try to do the as much a he could with his body and his
his old and with the swinging of the
it be a very big circle he say
but he be circle
then the line would not come in any more and he it until he saw the from it in the sun
then it out and the old man kneel down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water
he be make the far part of his circle now he say
i must hold all i can he think
the strain will shorten his circle each time
perhaps in an hour i will see him
now i must convince him and then i must kill him
but the fish kept on circle slowly and the old man be wet with sweat and tired deep into his two later
but the be much short now and from the way the line he could tell the fish have rise steadily while he swim
for an hour the old man have be see black before his and the sweat salt his and salt the cut over his eye and on his forehead
he be not afraid of the black
they be normal at the tension that he be on the line
twice though he have felt faint and dizzy and that have worry him
i could not fail myself and die on a fish like this he say
now that i have him come so beautifully god help me endure
i say a hundred our and a hundred hail
but i can not say them now
consider them say he think
i say them later
just then he felt a sudden banging and on the line he with his two
it be sharp and and heavy
he be the wire leader with his spear he think
that be bind to come
he have to do that
it may make him jump though and i would rather he stay circle now
the be necessary for him to take air
but after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook
do jump fish he say
do jump
the fish hit the wire several time more and each time he shake his head the old man give up a little line
i must hold his pain where it be he think
mine do not matter
i can control mine
but his pain could drive him mad
after a while the fish stop beat at the wire and circle slowly again
the old man be gain line steadily now
but he felt faint again
he some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head
then he put more on and rub the back of his neck
i have no he say
he be up soon and i can last
you have to last
do even speak of it
he against the bow and for a moment slip the line over his back again
i rest now while he go out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he come in he decide
it be a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without any line
but when the strain the fish have turn to come toward the boat the old man rise to his and the and the weaving that bring in all the line he
i than i have ever be he think and now the trade wind be rise
but that will be good to take him in with
i need that badly
i rest on the next turn a he go out he say
i feel much good
then in two or three turn more i will have him
his straw hat be far on the back of his head and he sink down into the bow with the pull of the line a he felt the fish turn
you work now fish he think
i take you at the turn
the sea have rise considerably
but it be a breeze and he have to have it to get home
i just steer south and west he say
a man be never lose at sea and it be a long island
it be on the third turn that he saw the fish first
he saw him first a a dark shadow that take so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe it length
no he say
he ca be that big
but he be that big and at the end of this circle he come to the surface only thirty away and the man saw his tail out of water
it be high than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water
it back and a the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple that band him
his dorsal fin be down and his huge be spread wide
on this circle the old man could see the fish eye and the two gray suck fish that swam around him
sometimes they attach themselves to him
sometimes they off
sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow
they be each over three long and when they swim fast they their whole like
the old man be sweat now but from something else besides the sun
on each calm placid turn the fish make he be gain line and he be sure that in two turn more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in
but i must get him close close close he think
i must try for the head
i must get the heart
be calm and strong old man he say
on the next circle the fish back be out but he be a little too far from the boat
on the next circle he be still too far away but he be high out of water and the old man be sure that by gain some more line he could have him alongside
he have his harpoon long before and it coil of light rope be in a round basket and the end be make fast to the bitt in the bow
the fish be come in on his circle now calm and beautiful look and only his great tail move
the old man on him all that he could to bring him closer
for just a moment the fish turn a little on his side
then he himself and another circle
i him the old man say
i him then
he felt faint again now but he on the great fish all the strain that he could
i him he think
maybe this time i can get him over
pull he think
hold up
last for me head
last for me
you never go
this time i pull him over
but when he put all of his effort on start it well out before the fish come alongside and with all his strength the fish part way over and then himself and swim away
fish the old man say
fish you be go to have to die anyway
do you have to kill me too
that way nothing be accomplish he think
his mouth be too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now
i must get him alongside this time he think
i be not good for many more turn
yes you be he tell himself
you good for ever
on the next turn he nearly have him
but again the fish himself and swim slowly away
you be kill me fish the old man think
but you have a right to
never have i see a great or more beautiful or a calmer or more noble thing than you brother
come on and kill me
i do not care who who
now you be get confuse in the head he think
you must keep your head clear
keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man
or a fish he think
clear up head he say in a voice he could hardly hear
clear up
twice more it be the same on the turn
i do not know the old man think
he have be on the point of feel himself go each time
i do not know
but i will try it once more
he try it once more and he felt himself go when he turn the fish
the fish himself and swim off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air
i try it again the old man although his be mushy now and he could only see well in
he try it again and it be the same
so he think and he felt himself go before he i will try it once again
he take all his pain and what be leave of his strength and his long go pride and he put it against the fish agony and the fish come over onto his side and swam gently on his side his bill almost touch the planking of the skiff and to pass the boat long deep wide silver and bar with purple and interminable in the water
the old man the line and put his foot on it and the harpoon as high a he could and drive it down with all his strength and more strength he have just into the fish side just behind the great chest fin that rise high in the air to the altitude of the man chest
he felt the iron go in and he on it and drive it far and then all his weight after it
then the fish come alive with his death in him and rise high out of the water show all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty
he to in the air above the old man in the skiff
then he fell into the water with a crash that send spray over the old man and over all of the skiff
the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well
but he the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw and when he could see he saw the fish be on his back with his silver belly up
the shaft of the harpoon be project at an angle from the fish shoulder and the sea be with the red of the blood from his heart
first it be dark a a shoal in the blue water that be more than a mile deep
then it spread like a cloud
the fish be silvery and still and with the
the old man carefully in the glimpse of vision that he have
then he take two turn of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and lay his head on his
keep my head clear he say against the wood of the bow
i be a tired old man
but i have this fish which be my brother and now i must do the slave work
now i must prepare the and the rope to lash him alongside he think
even if we be two and her to load him and her out this skiff would never hold him
i must prepare everything then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home
he to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow
i want to see him he think and to touch and to feel him
he be my fortune he think
but that be not why i wish to feel him
i think i felt his heart he think
when i on the harpoon shaft the second time
bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff
get to work old man he say
he take a very small drink of the water
there be very much slave work to be do now that the fight be over
he up at the sky and then out to his fish
he at the sun carefully
it be not much more than noon he think
and the trade wind be rise
the all mean nothing now
the boy and i will splice them when we be home
come on fish he say
but the fish do not come
instead he lay there now in the and the old man the skiff up onto him
when he be even with him and have the fish head against the bow he could not believe his size
but he untie the harpoon rope from the bitt it through the fish and out his make a turn around his sword then the rope through the other gill make another turn around the bill and knot the double rope and make it fast to the bitt in the bow
he cut the rope then and go astern to noose the tail
the fish have turn silver from his original purple and silver and the the same pale violet colour a his tail
they be than a man hand with his spread and the fish eye as detach a the in a periscope or a a saint in a procession
it be the only way to kill him the old man say
he be feel good since the water and he know he would not go away and his head be clear
he over fifteen hundred the way he be he think
maybe much more
if he out of that at thirty a pound
i need a pencil for that he say
my head be not that clear
but i think the great would be of me today
i have no bone
but the and the back hurt truly
i wonder what a bone spur be he think
maybe we have them without know of it
he make the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart
he be so big it be like a much big skiff alongside
he cut a piece of line and tie the fish low jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly a possible
then he step the mast and with the stick that be his gaff and with his boom the sail draw the boat to move and half lying in the stern he sail
he do not need a compass to tell him where be
he only the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail
i well put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture
but he could not find a spoon and his be rotten
so he hook a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff a they and shake it so that the small that be in it fell onto the planking of the skiff
there be more than a dozen of them and they and like sand
the old man pinch their off with his thumb and forefinger and eat them up the and the
they be very tiny but he know they be nourish and they taste good
the old man still have two of water in the bottle and he use half of one after he have eat the
the skiff be sail well consider the and he with the tiller under his arm
he could see the fish and he have only to look at his and feel his back against the stern to know that this have truly and be not a dream
at one time when he be feel so badly toward the end he have think perhaps it be a dream
then when he have see the fish come out of the water and motionless in the sky before he fell he be sure there be some great strangeness and he could not believe it
then he could not see well although now he saw as well a ever
now he know there be the fish and his and back be no dream
the cure quickly he think
i them clean and the salt water will heal them
the dark water of the true gulf be the healer that there be
all i must do be keep the head clear
the have do their work and we sail well
with his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like
then his head to become a little unclear and he think be he me in or be i him in
if i be tow him behind there would be no question
nor if the fish be in the skiff with all dignity go there would be no question either
but they be sail together side by side and the old man think let him bring me in if it him
i be only good than him through trickery and he mean me no harm
they sail well and the old man soak his in the salt water and try to keep his head clear
there be high cumulus and enough cirrus above them so that the old man know the breeze would last all night
the old man at the fish constantly to make sure it be true
it be an hour before the first shark hit him
the shark be not an accident
he have come up from deep down in the water a the dark cloud of blood have settle and disperse in the mile deep sea
he have come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he break the surface of the blue water and be in the sun
then he fell back into the sea and pick up the scent and swimming on the course the skiff and the fish have take
sometimes he lose the scent
but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he swim fast and hard on the course
he be a very big mako shark build to swim as fast a the fish in the sea and everything about him be beautiful except his
his back be as blue a a sword fish and his belly be silver and his hide be smooth and handsome
he be build a a sword fish except for his huge which be tight shut now a he swim fast just under the surface with his high dorsal fin through the water without waver
inside the closed double lip of his all of his eight of teeth be inwards
they be not the ordinary teeth of most
they be shape like a when they be crisp like
they be nearly as long a the of the old man and they have cut on both side
this be a fish build to fee on all the in the sea that be so fast and strong and well arm that they have no other enemy
now he up a he smell the scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water
when the old man saw him come he know that this be a shark that have no fear at all and would do exactly what he wish
he prepare the harpoon and make the rope fast while he watch the shark come on
the rope be short a it what he have cut away to lash the fish
the old man head be clear and good now and he be full of resolution but he have little hope
it be too good to last he think
he take one look at the great fish a he watch the shark close in
it might as well have be a dream he think
i can not keep him from me but maybe i can get him
he think
bad luck to your mother
the shark close fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange and the chop of the teeth a he drive forward in the meat just above the tail
the shark head be out of water and his back be come out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he the harpoon down onto the shark head at a spot where the line between his with the line that run straight back from his nose
there be no such
there be only the heavy sharp blue head and the big and the thrusting
but that be the location of the brain and the old man hit it
he hit it with his blood mush drive a good harpoon with all his strength
he hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy
the shark swung over and the old man saw his eye be not alive and then he swing over once again wrap himself in two of the rope
the old man know that he be dead but the shark would not accept it
then on his back with his tail and his the shark over the water a a do
the water be white where his tail beat it and of his body be clear above the water when the rope come taut and then snap
the shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watch him
then he go down very slowly
he take about forty the old man say aloud
he take my harpoon too and all the rope he think and now my fish again and there will be
he do not like to look at the fish since he have be
when the fish have be hit it be a though he himself be hit
but i the shark that hit my fish he think
and he be the big that i have ever see
and god that i have see big
it be too good to last he think
i wish it have be a dream now and that i have never hook the fish and be alone in bed on the
but man be not make for defeat he say
a man can be but not
i be sorry that i the fish though he think
now the bad time be come and i do not even have the harpoon
the be cruel and able and strong and intelligent
but i be more intelligent that he be
perhaps not he think
perhaps i be only well arm
do think old man he say aloud
sail on this course and take it when it come
but i must think he think
because it be all i have leave
that and baseball
i wonder how the great would have the way i hit him in the brain
it be no great thing he think
any man could do it
but do you think my be as great a handicap a the bone
i can not know
i never have anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when i step on him when swimming and the low leg and make the unbearable pain
think about something cheerful old man he say
every minute now you be close to home
you sail light for the loss of forty
he know quite well the pattern of what could happen when he the inner part of the current
but there be nothing to be do now
yes there be he say aloud
i can lash my knife to the butt of one of the
so he do that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot
now he say
i be still an old man
but i be not unarmed
the breeze be fresh now and he sail on well
he watch only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope return
it be silly not to hope he think
besides i believe it be a sin
do not think about sin he think
there be enough now without sin
also i have no understanding of it
i have no understanding of it and i be not sure that i believe in it
perhaps it be a sin to kill the fish
i suppose it be even though i do it to keep me alive and fee many people
but then everything be a sin
do not think about sin
it be much too late for that and there be people who be to do it
let them think about it
you be bear to be a fisherman a the fish be bear to be a fish
san pedro be a fisherman a be the father of the great
but he to think about all that he be involve in and since there be nothing to read and he do not have a radio he think much and he keep on think about sin
you do not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food he think
you him for pride and because you be a fisherman
you him when he be alive and you him after
it you love him it be not a sin to kill him
or be it more
you think too much old man he say aloud
but you kill the he think
he on the live fish a you do
he be not a scavenger nor just a move appetite a some be
he be beautiful and noble and no fear of anything
i him in the old man say aloud
and i him well
besides he think everything everything else in some way
fish me exactly a it me alive
the boy me alive he think
i must not deceive myself too much
he over the side and loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark have cut him
he it and note it quality and it good taste
it be firm and juicy like meat but it be not red
there be no stringiness in it and he know that it would bring the high price in the market
but there be no way to keep it scent out of the water and the old man know that a very bad time be come
the breeze be steady
it have back a little further into the and he know that meant that it would not fall off
the old man ahead of him but he could see no nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship
there be only the fly fish that go up from his bow sail away to either side and the yellow of
he could not even see a bird
he have sail for two resting in the stern and sometimes a bit of the meat from the marlin try to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two
he say aloud
there be no translation for this word and perhaps it be just a noise such a a man might make involuntarily feel the nail go through his and into the wood
he say aloud
he have see the second fin now come up behind the first and have them a by the brown triangular fin and the sweeping of the tail
they have the scent and be excite and in the stupidity of their great hunger they be lose and find the scent in their excitement
but they be all the time
the old man make the sheet fast and the tiller
then he take up the oar with the knife to it
he it as lightly a he could because his at the pain
then he and close them on it lightly to loosen them
he close them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watch the come
he could see their wide now and their wide pectoral
they be hateful bad smelling as well a and when they be hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat
it be these that would cut the and off when the be asleep on the surface and they would hit a man in the water if they be hungry even if the man have no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him
the old man say

come on
they come
but they do not come a the mako have come
one turn and go out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake a he and on the fish
the other watch the old man with his slitted yellow and then come in fast with his half circle of wide to hit the fish where he have already be bite
the line clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain the spinal cord and the old man drive the knife on the oar into the juncture it and drive it in again into the yellow
the shark let go of the fish and slide down what he have take a he
the skiff be still shake with the destruction the other shark be do to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under
when he saw the shark he over the side and at him
he hit only meat and the hide be set hard and he barely get the knife in
the blow hurt not only his but his shoulder too
but the shark come up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his head a his nose come out of water and lay against the fish
the old man the blade and the shark exactly in the same spot again
he still to the fish with his hooked and the old man him in his left eye
the shark still there
no
the old man say and he drive the blade between the vertebra and the brain
it be an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever
the old man reverse the oar and put the blade between the shark to open them
he twist the blade and a the shark slide loose he say go on
slide down a mile deep
go see your friend or maybe it your mother
the old man the blade of his knife and lay down the oar
then he find the sheet and the sail fill and he bring the skiff onto her course
they must have take a quarter of him and of the best meat he say aloud
i wish it be a dream and that i have never hook him
sorry about it fish
it everything wrong
he stop and he do not want to look at the fish now
drain of blood and awash he the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his still
i should have go out so far fish he say
neither for you nor for me
i sorry fish
now he say to himself
look to the on the knife and see if it be cut
then get your hand in order because there still be more to come
i wish i have a stone for the knife the old man say after he have check the on the oar butt
i should have bring a stone
you should have bring many he think
but you do not bring them old man
now be no time to think of what you do not have
think of what you can do with what there be
you give me much good counsel he say aloud
i tire of it
he the tiller under his arm and soak both his in the water a the skiff drive forward
god how much that last one take he say
but she much light now
he do not want to think of the of the fish
he know that each of the of the shark have be meat tear away and that the fish now make a trail for all as wide a a highway through the sea
he be a fish to keep a man all winter he think
do think of that
just rest and try to get your in shape to defend what be leave of him
the blood smell from my nothing now with all that scent in the water
besides they do not bleed much
there be nothing cut that anything
the bleeding may keep the left from cramp
what can i think of now
he think
nothing
i must think of nothing and wait for the next
i wish it have really be a dream he think
but who
it might have turn out well
the next shark that come be a single
he come like a pig to the trough if a pig have a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it
the old man let him hit the fish and then drive the knife on the oar down into his brain
but the shark backwards a he roll and the knife blade snap
the old man settle himself to steer
he do not even watch the big shark sink slowly in the water show first then small then tiny
that always fascinate the old man
but he do not even watch it now
i have the gaff now he say
but it will do no good
i have the two and the tiller and the short club
now they have beat me he think
i be too old to club to death
but i will try it as long a i have the and the short club and the tiller
he put his in the water again to soak them
it be get late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky
there be more wind in the sky than there have be and soon he hop that he would see land
you tire old man he say
you tire inside
the do not hit him again until just before sunset
the old man saw the brown come along the wide trail the fish must make in the water
they be not even quarter on the scent
they be head straight for the skiff swimming side by side
he the tiller make the sheet fast and under the stern for the club
it be an oar handle from a broken oar saw off to about two and a half in length
he could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he take good hold of it with his right hand his hand on it a he watch the come
they be both
i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head he think
the two close together and a he saw the one near him open his and sink them into the silver side of the fish he raise the club high and bring it down heavy and onto the top of the shark broad head
he felt the rubbery solidity a the club come down
but he felt the rigidity of bone too and he strike the shark once more hard across the point of the nose a he slide down from the fish
the other shark have be in and out and now come in again with his wide
the old man could see of the meat of the fish white from the corner of his a he the fish and close his
he swing at him and hit only the head and the shark at him and wrench the meat loose
the old man swing the club down on him again a he slip away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
come on the old man say
come in again
the shark come in a rush and the old man hit him a he shut his
he hit him solidly and from as high up a he could raise the club
this time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tear the meat loose sluggishly and slide down from the fish
the old man watch for him to come again but neither shark
then he saw one on the surface swimming in
he do not see the fin of the other
i could not expect to kill them he think
i could have in my time
but i have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good
if i could have use a bat with two i could have the first one surely
even now he think
he do not want to look at the fish
he know that half of him have be
the sun have go down while he have be in the fight with the
it will be dark soon he say
then i should see the glow of
if i be too far to the eastward i will see the of one of the new
i can not be too far out now he think
i hope no one be too worried
there be only the boy to worry of course
but i be sure he would have confidence
many of the old will worry
many too he think
i live in a good town
he could not talk to the fish because the fish have be ruin too badly
then something come into his head
half fish he say
fish that you be
i be sorry that i go too far out
i ruin u both
but we have many you and i and ruin many
how many do you ever kill old fish
you do not have that spear on your head for nothing
he to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he be swim free
i should have chop the bill off to fight them with he think
but there be no hatchet and then there be no knife
but if i have and could have it to an oar butt what a weapon
then we might have fight them together
what will you do now if they come in the night
what can you do
fight them he say
i fight them until i die
but in the dark now and no glow showing and no and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he be already dead
he put his two together and felt the
they be not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply open and them
he his back against the stern and know he be not dead
his tell him
i have all those i if i catch the fish he think
but i be too tired to say them now
i well get the sack and put it over my
he lay in the stern and and watch for the glow to come in the sky
i have half of him he think
maybe i have the luck to bring the forward half in
i should have some luck
no he say
you your luck when you go too far outside
do be silly he say aloud
and keep awake and steer
you may have much luck yet
i like to buy some if there any place they sell it he say
what could i buy it with
he himself
could i buy it with a lose harpoon and a broken knife and two bad
you might he say
you try to buy it with day at sea
they nearly sell it to you too
i must not think nonsense he think
luck be a thing that come in many and who can recognize her
i would take some though in any form and pay what they
i wish i could see the glow from the he think
i wish too many
but that be the thing i wish for now
he try to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he know he be not dead
he saw the reflected glare of the of the city at what must have be around ten at night
they be only perceptible at first a the light be in the sky before the moon
then they be steady to see across the ocean which be rough now with the increase breeze
he inside of the glow and he think that now soon he must hit the edge of the stream
now it be over he think
they will probably hit me again
but what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon
he be stiff and sore now and his wound and all of the strain of his body hurt with the cold of the night
i hope i do not have to fight again he think
i hope so much i do not have to fight again
but by midnight he fight and this time he know the fight be useless
they come in a pack and he could only see the in the water that their make and their phosphorescence a they throw themselves on the fish
he club at and the chop and the shaking of the skiff a they take hold below
he club desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it be go
he the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chop with it hold it in both and drive it down again and again
but they be up to the bow now and drive in one after the other and together tear off the of meat that glow below the sea a they turn to come once more
one come finally against the head itself and he know that it be over
he swing the tiller across the shark head where the be catch in the heaviness of the fish head which would not tear
he swing it once and twice and again
he the tiller break and he lunge at the shark with the butt
he felt it go in and know it be sharp he drive it in again
the shark let go and roll away
that be the last shark of the pack that come
there be nothing more for them to eat
the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth
it be coppery and sweet and he be afraid of it for a moment
but there be not much of it
he spat into the ocean and say eat that
and make a dream you a man
he know he be beaten now finally and without remedy and he go back to the stern and find the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer
he settle the sack around his and put the skiff on her course
he sail lightly now and he have no nor any of any kind
he be past everything now and he sail the skiff to make his home port a well and as intelligently a he could
in the night hit the carcass a someone might pick up from the table
the old man no attention to them and do not pay any attention to anything except steer
he only how lightly and how well the skiff sail now there be no great weight beside her
she good he think
she be sound and not in any way except for the tiller
that be easily
he could feel he be inside the current now and he could see the of the beach along the shore
he know where he be now and it be nothing to get home
the wind be our friend anyway he think
then he add sometimes
and the great sea with our and our
and bed he think
bed be my friend
just bed he think
bed will be a great thing
it be easy when you be beat he think
i never know how easy it be
and what beat you he think
nothing he say aloud
i go out too far
when he sail into the little harbour the of the terrace be out and he know everyone be in bed
the breeze have rise steadily and be blow strongly now
it be quiet in the harbour though and he sail up onto the little patch of shingle below the
there be no one to help him so he the boat up as far a he could
then he step out and make her fast to a rock
he the mast and the sail and tie it
then he shoulder the mast and to climb
it be then he know the depth of his tiredness
he stop for a moment and back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish stand up well behind the skiff stern
he saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between
he to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder
he try to get up
but it be too difficult and he sit there with the mast on his shoulder and at the road
a cat on the far side go about it business and the old man watch it
then he just watch the road
finally he put the mast down and stand up
he pick the mast up and put it on his shoulder and up the road
he have to sit down five time before he his shack
inside the shack he the mast against the wall
in the dark he find a water bottle and take a drink
then he lay down on the bed
he the blanket over his and then over his back and and he sleep face down on the with his arm out straight and the of his up
he be asleep when the boy in the door in the morning
it be blow so hard that the would not be go out and the boy have sleep late and then come to the old man shack a he have come each morning
the boy saw that the old man be breathe and then he saw the old man and he to cry
he go out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he be cry
