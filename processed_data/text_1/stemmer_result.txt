the success of that day were alreadi in and had their marlin out and carri them laid full length across two with two men stagger at the end of each plank to the fish hous where they for the ice truck to carri them to the market in
those who had caught had taken them to the shark factori on the other side of the cove where they were on a block and tackl their remov their cut off and their skin out and their flesh cut into for salt
when the wind wa in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factori but today there wa onli the faint edg of the becaus the wind had back into the north and then off and it wa pleasant and sunni on the terrac

the box with the wa under the stern of the skiff along with the club that wa use to subdu the big fish when they were brought alongsid
no one would steal from the old man but it wa better to take the sail and the heavi home as the dew wa bad for them and though he wa quit sure no local peopl would steal from him the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless to leav in a boat
they up the road togeth to the old man shack and went in through it open door
the old man the mast with it wrap sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear besid it
the mast wa nearli as long as the one room of the shack

the boy wa back now with the and the two wrap in a newspap and they went down the trail to the skiff feel the pebbl sand under their and the skiff and slid her into the water
good luck old man
good luck the old man said
he fit the rope of the onto the thole and lean forward against the thrust of the in the water he to row out of the harbour in the dark
there were other from the other go out to sea and the old man the dip and push of their even though he could not see them now the moon wa below the
sometim someon would speak in a boat
but most of the were silent except for the dip of the
they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one head for the part of the ocean where he hope to find fish
the old man knew he wa go far out and he left the smell of the land behind and row out into the clean earli morn smell of the ocean
he saw the phosphoresc of the gulf weed in the water as he row over the part of the ocean that the the great well becaus there wa a sudden deep of seven hundr where all of fish becaus of the swirl the current made against the steep of the floor of the ocean
here there were of shrimp and bait fish and sometim of squid in the and these rose close to the surfac at night where all the wander fish fed on them
in the dark the old man could feel the morn come and as he row he the trembl sound as fli fish left the water and the hiss that their stiff set made as they away in the dark
he wa veri of fli fish as they were hi princip on the ocean
he wa sorri for the especi the small delic dark that were alway fli and look and almost never find and he thought the have a harder life than we do except for the robber and the heavi strong
whi did they make so delic and fine as those sea when the ocean can be so cruel
she is kind and veri beauti
but she can be so cruel and it come so suddenli and such that fli dip and hunt with their small sad are made too delic for the sea
he alway thought of the sea as which is what peopl call her in when they love her
sometim those who love her say bad of her but they are alway said as though she were a woman
some of the younger those who use as for their and had bought when the shark had brought much money spoke of her as which is masculin
they spoke of her as a contest or a place or even an enemi
but the old man alway thought of her as feminin and as someth that gave or withheld great and if she did wild or wick it wa becaus she could not help them
the moon her as it doe a woman he thought
he wa row steadili and it wa no effort for him sinc he kept well within hi speed and the surfac of the ocean wa flat except for the occasion of the current
he wa the current do a third of the work and as it to be light he saw he wa alreadi further out than he had hope to be at thi hour
i work the deep for a week and did noth he thought
today i work out where the of and albacor are and mayb there will be a big one with them
befor it wa realli light he had hi out and wa drift with the current
one bait wa down forti
the second wa at and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundr and one hundr and
each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook insid the bait fish tie and sew solid and all the project part of the hook the curv and the point wa cover with fresh
each sardin wa hook through both so that they made a on the project steel
there wa no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which wa not sweet smell and good tast
the boy had given him two fresh small or which hung on the two like and on the he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been use befor but they were in good condit still and had the excel to give them scent and attract
each line as thick around as a big pencil wa onto a stick so that ani pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two which could be made fast to the other spare so that if it were necessari a fish could take out over three hundr of line
now the man watch the dip of the three stick over the side of the skiff and row gentli to keep the straight up and down and at their proper
it wa quit light and ani moment now the sun would rise
the sun rose thinli from the sea and the old man could see the other low on the water and well in toward the shore spread out across the current
then the sun wa and the glare came on the water and then as it rose clear the flat sea sent it back at hi so that it hurt sharpli and he row without look into it
he down into the water and watch the that went straight down into the dark of the water
he kept them than anyon did so that at each level in the dark of the stream there would be a bait wait exactli where he wish it to be for ani fish that swam there
let them drift with the current and sometim they were at sixti when the thought they were at a hundr
but he thought i keep them with precis
onli i have no luck ani more
but who
mayb today
everi day is a new day
it is better to be lucki
but i would rather be exact
then when luck come you are readi
the sun wa two higher now and it did not hurt hi so much to look into the east
there were onli three in sight now and they veri low and far inshor
all my life the earli sun hurt my he thought
yet they are still good
in the even i can look straight into it without get the black
it more forc in the even too
but in the morn it is pain
just then he saw a bird with hi long black circl in the sky ahead of him
he made a quick drop slant down on hi and then circl again
he got someth the old man said aloud
he not just look
he row slowli and steadili toward where the bird wa circl
he did not hurri and he kept hi straight up and down
but he crowd the current a littl so that he wa still fish correctli though faster than he would have fish if he wa not tri to use the bird
the bird went higher in the air and circl again hi motionless
then he dove suddenli and the old man saw fli fish spurt out of the water and sail desper over the surfac
dolphin the old man said aloud
big dolphin
he ship hi and brought a small line from under the bow
it had a wire leader and a hook and he it with one of the
he let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern
then he anoth line and left it coil in the shade of the bow
he went back to row and to watch the black bird who wa work now low over the water
as he watch the bird dip again slant hi for the dive and then swing them wildli and ineffectu as he the fli fish
the old man could see the slight bulg in the water that the big dolphin rais as they the fish
the dolphin were cut through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water drive at speed when the fish
it is a big school of dolphin he thought
they are wide spread and the fli fish have littl chanc
the bird no chanc
the fli fish are too big for him and they go too fast
he watch the fli fish burst out again and again and the ineffectu of the bird
that school gotten away from me he thought
they are move out too fast and too far
but perhap i will pick up a stray and perhap my big fish is around them
my big fish must be somewher
the over the land now rose like and the coast wa onli a long green line with the gray blue behind it
the water wa a dark blue now so dark that it wa almost purpl
as he down into it he saw the red sift of the plankton in the dark water and the strang light the sun made now
he watch hi to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he wa happi to see so much plankton becaus it meant fish
the strang light the sun made in the water now that the sun wa higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the over the land
but the bird wa almost out of sight now and noth on the surfac of the water but some of yellow sargasso weed and the purpl iridesc gelatin bladder of a float close besid the boat
it turn on it side and then itself
it cheer as a bubbl with it long deadli purpl trail a yard behind it in the water
the man said
you whore
from where he swung lightli against hi he down into the water and saw the tini fish that were like the trail and swam between them and under the small shade the bubbl made as it
they were immun to it poison
but men were not and when some of the would catch on a line and rest there slimi and purpl while the old man wa work a fish he would have and on hi arm and of the sort that poison ivi or poison oak can give
but these from the came quickli and struck like a whiplash
the iridesc were beauti
but they were the thing in the sea and the old man to see the big sea eat them
the saw them them from the front then shut their so they were complet carapac and ate them and all
the old man to see the eat them and he to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he step on them with the horni sole of hi
he green and with their eleg and speed and their great valu and he had a friendli contempt for the huge stupid yellow in their strang in their and happili eat the with their shut
he had no mystic about although he had gone in turtl for mani
he wa sorri for them all even the great trunk that were as long as the skiff and weigh a ton
most peopl are heartless about becaus a turtl heart will beat for after he been cut up and
but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my and are like their
he ate the white to give himself strength
he ate them all through may to be strong in and for the truli big fish
he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where mani of the kept their gear
it wa there for all who it
most the tast
but it wa no wors than get up at the that they rose and it wa veri good against all and and it wa good for the
now the old man up and saw that the bird wa circl again
he found fish he said aloud
no fli fish broke the surfac and there wa no scatter of bait fish
but as the old man watch a small tuna rose in the air turn and head first into the water
the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had back into the water anoth and anoth rose and they were in all churn the water and leap in long after the bait
they were circl it and drive it
if they do travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watch the school work the water white and the bird now drop and dip into the bait fish that were forc to the surfac in their panic
the bird is a great help the old man said
just then the stern line came taut under hi foot where he had kept a loop of the line and he hi and felt the weight of the small tuna shiver pull as he the line firm and to haul it in
the shiver as he in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of hi side befor he swung him over the side and into the boat
he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shape hi big unintellig stare as he hi life out against the plank of the boat with the quick shiver of hi neat tail
the old man hit him on the head for kind and him hi bodi still under the shade of the stern
albacor he said aloud
he make a beauti bait
he weigh ten
he did not rememb when he had first to talk aloud when he wa by himself
he had sung when he wa by himself in the old day and he had sung at night sometim when he wa alon steer on hi watch in the or in the turtl
he had probabl to talk aloud when alon when the boy had left
but he did not rememb
when he and the boy fish togeth they usual spoke onli when it wa necessari
they at night or when they were by bad weather
it wa consid a virtu not to talk unnecessarili at sea and the old man had alway consid it so and it
but now he said hi aloud mani time sinc there wa no one that they could annoy
if the me talk out loud they would think that i am crazi he said aloud
but sinc i am not crazi i do not care
and the rich have to talk to them in their and to bring them the basebal
now is no time to think of basebal he thought
now is the time to think of onli one thing
that which i wa born for
there might be a big one around that school he thought
i pick up onli a straggler from the albacor that were feed
but they are work far out and fast
everyth that on the surfac today veri fast and to the
can that be the time of day
or is it some sign of weather that i do not know
he could not see the green of the shore now but onli the top of the blue that white as though they were and the that like high snow abov them
the sea wa veri dark and the light made in the water
the myriad of the plankton were now by the high sun and it wa onli the great deep in the blue water that the old man saw now with hi go straight down into the water that wa a mile deep
the tuna the all the fish of that speci tuna and onli distinguish among them by their proper when they came to sell them or to trade them for were down again
the sun wa hot now and the old man felt it on the back of hi neck and felt the sweat trickl down hi back as he row
i could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me
but today is day and i should fish the day well
just then watch hi he saw one of the project green stick dip sharpli
ye he said
ye and ship hi without bump the boat
he out for the line and it softli between the thumb and forefing of hi right hand
he felt no strain nor weight and he the line lightli
then it came again
thi time it wa a tent pull not solid nor heavi and he knew exactli what it wa
one hundr down a marlin wa eat the that cover the point and the shank of the hook where the hook from the head of the small tuna
the old man the line delic and softli with hi left hand unleash it from the stick
now he could let it run through hi without the fish feel ani tension
thi far out he must be huge in thi month he thought
eat them fish
eat them
pleas eat them
how fresh they are and you down there six hundr in that cold water in the dark
make anoth turn in the dark and come back and eat them
he felt the light delic and then a harder pull when a sardin head must have been more difficult to break from the hook
then there wa noth
come on the old man said aloud
make anoth turn
just smell them
are they love
eat them good now and then there is the tuna
hard and cold and love
do be shi fish
eat them
he with the line between hi thumb and hi finger watch it and the other at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down
then came the same delic touch again
he take it the old man said aloud
god help him to take it
he did not take it though
he wa gone and the old man felt noth
he ca have gone he said
he ca have gone
make a turn
mayb he been hook befor and he someth of it
then he felt the gentl touch on the line and he wa happi
it wa onli hi turn he said
he take it
he wa happi feel the gentl and then he felt someth hard and unbeliev heavi
it wa the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unrol off the first of the two reserv
as it went down slip lightli through the old he still could feel the great weight though the pressur of hi thumb and finger were almost impercept
what a fish he said
he it sideway in hi mouth now and he is move off with it
then he will turn and swallow it he thought
he did not say that becaus he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen
he knew what a huge fish thi wa and he thought of him move away in the dark with the tuna crosswis in hi mouth
at that moment he felt him stop move but the weight wa still there
then the weight and he gave more line
he the pressur of hi thumb and finger for a moment and the weight and wa go straight down
he taken it he said
now i let him eat it well
he let the line slip through hi while he down with hi left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserv to the loop of the two reserv of the next line
now he wa readi
he had three of line in reserv now as well as the coil he wa
eat it a littl more he said
eat it well
eat it so that the point of the hook goe into your heart and you he thought
come up easi and let me put the harpoon into you
all right
are you readi
have you been long enough at tabl
now
he said aloud and struck hard with both a yard of line and then struck again and again swing with each arm altern on the cord with all the strength of hi arm and the weight of hi bodi
noth
the fish just away slowli and the old man could not rais him an inch
hi line wa strong and made for heavi fish and he it against hi back until it wa so taut that of water were from it
then it to make a slow hiss sound in the water and he still it brace himself against the thwart and lean back against the pull
the boat to move slowli off toward the
the fish steadili and they travel slowli on the calm water
the other were still in the water but there wa noth to be done
i wish i had the boy the old man said aloud
i be by a fish and i the tow bitt
i could make the line fast
but then he could break it
i must hold him all i can and give him line when he must have it
thank god he is and not go down
what i will do if he to go down i do know
what i do if he and i do know
but i do someth
there are plenti of i can do
he the line against hi back and watch it slant in the water and the skiff move steadili to the
thi will kill him the old man thought
he ca do thi forev
but four later the fish wa still swim steadili out to sea tow the skiff and the old man wa still brace solidli with the line across hi back
it wa noon when i hook him he said
and i have never seen him
he had hi straw hat hard down on hi head befor he hook the fish and it wa cut hi forehead
he wa thirsti too and he got down on hi and be care not to jerk on the line as far into the bow as he could get and the water bottl with one hand
he it and drank a littl
then he against the bow
he sit on the mast and sail and tri not to think but onli to endur
then he behind him and saw that no land wa visibl
that no differ he thought
i can alway come in on the glow from
there are two more befor the sun and mayb he will come up befor that
if he doe mayb he will come up with the moon
if he doe not do that mayb he will come up with the sunris
i have no and i feel strong
it is he that the hook in hi mouth
but what a fish to pull like that
he must have hi mouth shut tight on the wire
i wish i could see him
i wish i could see him onli onc to know what i have against me
the fish never hi cours nor hi direct all that night as far as the man could tell from watch the
it wa cold after the sun went down and the old man sweat dri cold on hi back and hi arm and hi old
dure the day he had taken the sack that cover the bait box and spread it in the sun to dri
after the sun went down he tie it around hi neck so that it hung down over hi back and he cautious work it down under the line that wa across hi now
the sack cushion the line and he had found a way of lean forward against the bow so that he wa almost comfort
the posit actual wa onli somewhat less intoler but he thought of it as almost comfort
i can do noth with him and he can do noth with me he thought
not as long as he thi up
onc he stood up and over the side of the skiff and at the and check hi cours
the line like a phosphoresc streak in the water straight out from hi
they were move more slowli now and the glow of wa not so strong so that he knew the current must be carri them to the eastward
if i lose the glare of we must be go more to the eastward he thought
for if the fish cours true i must see it for mani more
i wonder how the basebal came out in the grand today he thought
it would be wonder to do thi with a radio
then he thought think of it alway
think of what you are do
you must do noth stupid
then he said aloud i wish i had the boy
to help me and to see thi
no one should be alon in their old age he thought
but it is unavoid
i must rememb to eat the tuna befor he in order to keep strong
rememb no matter how littl you want to that you must eat him in the morn
rememb he said to himself
dure the night two porpois came around the boat and he could hear them roll and blow
he could tell the differ between the blow nois the male made and the sigh blow of the femal
they are good he said
they play and make and love one anoth
they are our like the fli fish
then he to piti the great fish that he had hook
he is wonder and strang and who how old he is he thought
never have i had such a strong fish nor one who so strang
perhap he is too wise to jump
he could ruin me by or by a wild rush
but perhap he been hook mani time befor and he that thi is how he should make hi fight
he can not know that it is onli one man against him nor that it is an old man
but what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good
he took the bait like a male and he like a male and hi fight no panic in it
i wonder if he ani or if he is just as desper as i am
he the time he had hook one of a pair of marlin
the male fish alway let the femal fish feed first and the hook fish the femal made a wild despair fight that soon exhaust her and all the time the male had stay with her cross the line and circl with her on the surfac
he had stay so close that the old man wa afraid he would cut the line with hi tail which wa sharp as a scyth and almost of that size and shape
when the old man had her and club her hold the rapier bill with it sandpap edg and club her across the top of her head until her colour turn to a colour almost like the back of and then with the boy aid her aboard the male fish had stay by the side of the boat
then while the old man wa clear the and the harpoon the male fish high into the air besid the boat to see where the femal wa and then went down deep hi lavend that were hi pector spread wide and all hi wide lavend show
he wa beauti the old man and he had stay
that wa the thing i ever saw with them the old man thought
the boy wa sad too and we her pardon and her promptli
i wish the boy wa here he said aloud and settl himself against the round of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he across hi move steadili toward whatev he had chosen
when onc through my treacheri it had been necessari to him to make a choic the old man thought
hi choic had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all and trap and
my choic wa to go there to find him beyond all peopl
beyond all peopl in the world
now we are togeth and have been sinc noon
and no one to help either one of us
perhap i should not have been a fisherman he thought
but that wa the thing that i wa born for
i must sure rememb to eat the tuna after it light
some time befor daylight someth took one of the that were behind him
he the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwal of the skiff
in the dark he hi sheath knife and take all the strain of the fish on hi left shoulder he back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwal
then he cut the other line to him and in the dark made the loos of the reserv fast
he work skill with the one hand and put hi foot on the to hold them as he drew hi tight
now he had six reserv of line
there were two from each bait he had and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connect
after it is light he thought i will work back to the bait and cut it away too and link up the reserv
i will have lost two hundr of good and the and
that can be
but who thi fish if i hook some fish and it him off
i do know what that fish wa that took the bait just now
it could have been a marlin or a broadbil or a shark
i never felt him
i had to get rid of him too fast
aloud he said i wish i had the boy
but you have got the boy he thought
you have onli yourself and you had better work back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserv
so he did it
it wa difficult in the dark and onc the fish made a surg that him down on hi face and made a cut below hi eye
the blood ran down hi cheek a littl way
but it and dri befor it hi chin and he work hi way back to the bow and against the wood
he the sack and care work the line so that it came across a new part of hi and hold it anchor with hi he care felt the pull of the fish and then felt with hi hand the progress of the skiff through the water
i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought
the wire must have slip on the great hill of hi back
certainli hi back can not feel as badli as mine doe
but he can not pull thi skiff forev no matter how great he is
now everyth is away that might make troubl and i have a big reserv of line all that a man can ask
fish he said softli aloud i stay with you until i am dead
he stay with me too i suppos the old man thought and he for it to be light
it wa cold now in the time befor daylight and he against the wood to be warm
i can do it as long as he can he thought
and in the first light the line extend out and down into the water
the boat steadili and when the first edg of the sun rose it wa on the old man right shoulder
he head north the old man said
the current will have set us far to the eastward he thought
i wish he would turn with the current
that would show that he wa tire
when the sun had risen further the old man that the fish wa not tire
there wa onli one favor sign
the slant of the line he wa swim at a lesser depth
that did not necessarili mean that he would jump
but he might
god let him jump the old man said
i have enough line to handl him
mayb if i can increas the tension just a littl it will hurt him and he will jump he thought
now that it is daylight let him jump so that he fill the along hi backbon with air and then he can not go deep to die
he tri to increas the tension but the line had been taut up to the veri edg of the break point sinc he had hook the fish and he felt the harsh as he back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it
i must not jerk it ever he thought
each jerk the cut the hook and then when he doe jump he might throw it
anyway i feel better with the sun and for onc i do not have to look into it
there wa yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that onli made an ad drag and he wa
it wa the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphoresc in the night
fish he said i love you and respect you veri much
but i will kill you dead befor thi day
let us hope so he thought
a small bird came toward the skiff from the north
he wa a warbler and fli veri low over the water
the old man could see that he wa veri tire
the bird made the stern of the boat and there
then he flew around the old man head and on the line where he wa more comfort
how old are you
the old man the bird
is thi your first trip
the bird at him when he spoke
he wa too tire even to examin the line and he on it as hi delic it fast
it steadi the old man told him
it too steadi
you be that tire after a windless night
what are come to
the he thought that come out to sea to meet them
but he said noth of thi to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the soon enough
take a good rest small bird he said
then go in and take your chanc like ani man or bird or fish
it him to talk becaus hi back had in the night and it hurt truli now
stay at my hous if you like bird he said
i am sorri i can not hoist the sail and take you in with the small breez that is rise
but i am with a friend
just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that the old man down onto the bow and would have him overboard if he had not brace himself and given some line
the bird had flown up when the line and the old man had not even seen him go
he felt the line care with hi right hand and hi hand wa bleed
someth hurt him then he said aloud and back on the line to see if he could turn the fish
but when he wa touch the break point he steadi and settl back against the strain of the line
you feel it now fish he said
and so god am i
he around for the bird now becaus he would have him for compani
the bird wa gone
you did not stay long the man thought
but it is rougher where you are go until you make the shore
how did i let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made
i must be get veri stupid
or perhap i wa look at the small bird and think of him
now i will pay attent to my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failur of strength
i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt he said aloud
shift the weight of the line to hi left shoulder and kneel care he wash hi hand in the ocean and it there submerg for more than a minut watch the blood trail away and the steadi movement of the water against hi hand as the boat
he much he said
the old man would have to keep hi hand in the salt water longer but he wa afraid of anoth sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and brace himself and hi hand up against the sun
it wa onli a line burn that had cut hi flesh
but it wa in the work part of hi hand
he knew he would need hi befor thi wa over and he did not like to be cut befor it
now he said when hi hand had dri i must eat the small tuna
i can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort
he knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew it toward him keep it clear of the coil
hold the line with hi left shoulder again and brace on hi left hand and arm he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place
he put one knee on the fish and cut of dark red meat longitudin from the back of the head to the tail
they were and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edg of the belli
when he had cut six he spread them out on the wood of the bow hi knife on hi trouser and the carcass of the bonito by the tail and it overboard
i do think i can eat an entir one he said and drew hi knife across one of the
he could feel the steadi hard pull of the line and hi left hand wa cramp
it drew up tight on the heavi cord and he at it in disgust
what kind of a hand is that he said
cramp then if you want
make yourself into a claw
it will do you no good
come on he thought and down into the dark water at the slant of the line
eat it now and it will strengthen the hand
it is not the hand fault and you have been mani with the fish
but you can stay with him forev
eat the bonito now
he pick up a piec and put it in hi mouth and it slowli
it wa not unpleas
chew it well he thought and get all the
it would not be bad to eat with a littl lime or with lemon or with salt
how do you feel hand
he the cramp hand that wa almost as stiff as rigor
i eat some more for you
he ate the other part of the piec that he had cut in two
he it care and then spat out the skin
how doe it go hand
or is it too earli to know
he took anoth full piec and it
it is a strong fish he thought
i wa lucki to get him instead of dolphin
dolphin is too sweet
thi is hardli sweet at all and all the strength is still in it
there is no sens in be anyth but practic though he thought
i wish i had some salt
and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dri what is left so i had better eat it all although i am not hungri
the fish is calm and steadi
i will eat it all and then i will be readi
be patient hand he said
i do thi for you
i wish i could feed the fish he thought
he is my brother
but i must kill him and keep strong to do it
slowli and conscienti he ate all of the of fish
he up hi hand on hi trouser
now he said
you can let the cord go hand and i will handl him with the right arm alon until you stop that nonsens
he put hi left foot on the heavi line that the left hand had and lay back against the pull against hi back
god help me to have the cramp go he said
becaus i do not know what the fish is go to do
but he calm he thought and follow hi plan
but what is hi plan he thought
and what is mine
mine i must improvis to hi becaus of hi great size
if he will jump i can kill him
but he stay down forev
then i will stay down with him forev
he rub the cramp hand against hi trouser and tri to gentl the
but it would not open
mayb it will open with the sun he thought
mayb it will open when the strong raw tuna is digest
if i have to have it i will open it cost whatev it
but i do not want to open it now by forc
let it open by itself and come back of it own accord
after all i it much in the night when it wa necessari to free and unit the variou
he across the sea and knew how alon he wa now
but he could see the in the deep dark water and the line ahead and the strang undul of the calm
the were build up now for the trade wind and he ahead and saw a flight of wild etch themselv against the sky over the water then then etch again and he knew no man wa ever alon on the sea
he thought of how some men fear be out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the of sudden bad weather
but now they were in hurrican and when there are no the weather of hurrican is the best of all the year
if there is a hurrican you alway see the of it in the sky for day ahead if you are at sea
they do not see it ashor becaus they do not know what to look for he thought
the land must make a differ too in the shape of the
but we have no hurrican come now
he at the sky and saw the white cumulu built like friendli pile of ice cream and high abov were the thin of the cirru against the high sky
light he said
better weather for me than for you fish
hi left hand wa still cramp but he wa it slowli
i hate a cramp he thought
it is a treacheri of one own bodi
it is humili befor to have a from ptomain poison or to vomit from it
but a cramp he thought of it as a oneself especi when one is alon
if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought
but it will loosen up
then with hi right hand he felt the differ in the pull of the line befor he saw the slant chang in the water
then as he against the line and hi left hand hard and fast against hi thigh he saw the line slant slowli upward
he come up he said
come on hand
pleas come on
the line rose slowli and steadili and then the surfac of the ocean ahead of the boat and the fish came out
he came out unendingli and water from hi side
he wa bright in the sun and hi head and back were dark purpl and in the sun the on hi side wide and a light lavend
hi sword wa as long as a basebal bat and taper like a rapier and he rose hi full length from the water and then it smoothli like a diver and the old man saw the great of hi tail go under and the line to race out
he is two longer than the skiff the old man said
the line wa go out fast but steadili and the fish wa not panick
the old man wa tri with both to keep the line just insid of break strength
he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steadi pressur the fish could take out all the line and break it
he is a great fish and i must convinc him he thought
i must never let him learn hi strength nor what he could do if he made hi run
if i were him i would put in everyth now and go until someth broke
but thank god they are not as intellig as we who kill them although they are more nobl and more abl
the old man had seen mani great fish
he had seen mani that weigh more than a thousand and he had caught two of that size in hi life but never alon
now alon and out of sight of land he wa fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever of and hi left hand wa still as tight as the of an eagl
it will uncramp though he thought
sure it will uncramp to help my right hand
there are three that are the fish and my two
it must uncramp
it is unworthi of it to be cramp
the fish had again and wa go at hi usual pace
i wonder whi he the old man thought
he almost as though to show me how big he wa
i know now anyway he thought
i wish i could show him what sort of man i am
but then he would see the cramp hand
let him think i am more man than i am and i will be so
i wish i wa the fish he thought with everyth he against onli my will and my intellig
he settl comfort against the wood and took hi suffer as it came and the fish swam steadili and the boat slowli through the dark water
there wa a small sea rise with the wind come up from the east and at noon the old man left hand wa uncramp
bad news for you fish he said and the line over the that cover hi
he wa comfort but suffer although he did not admit the suffer at all
i am not religi he said
but i will say ten our and ten hail that i should catch thi fish and i promis to make a pilgrimag to the de if i catch him
that is a promis
he to say hi mechan
sometim he would be so tire that he could not rememb the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automat
hail are easier to say than our he thought
hail mari full of grace the lord is with thee
bless art thou among and bless is the fruit of thi womb
holi mari mother of god pray for us now and at the hour of our death
amen
then he ad bless virgin pray for the death of thi fish
wonder though he is
with hi said and feel much better but suffer exactli as much and perhap a littl more he against the wood of the bow and mechan to work the of hi left hand
the sun wa hot now although the breez wa rise gentli
i had better that littl line out over the stern he said
if the fish to stay anoth night i will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottl
i do think i can get anyth but a dolphin here
but if i eat him fresh enough he wo be bad
i wish a fli fish would come on board tonight
but i have no light to attract them
a fli fish is excel to eat raw and i would not have to cut him up
i must save all my strength now
i did not know he wa so big
i kill him though he said
in all hi great and hi glori
although it is unjust he thought
but i will show him what a man can do and what a man
i told the boy i wa a strang old man he said
now is when i must prove it
the thousand time that he had prove it meant noth
now he wa prove it again
each time wa a new time and he never thought about the past when he wa do it
i wish he sleep and i could sleep and dream about the he thought
whi are the the main thing that is left
do think old man he said to himself
rest gentli now against the wood and think of noth
he is work
work as littl as you can
it wa get into the afternoon and the boat still slowli and steadili
but there wa an ad drag now from the easterli breez and the old man rode gentli with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across hi back came to him easili and smoothli
onc in the afternoon the line to rise again
but the fish onli continu to swim at a slightli higher level
the sun wa on the old man left arm and shoulder and on hi back
so he knew the fish had turn east of north
now that he had seen him onc he could pictur the fish swim in the water with hi purpl pector set wide as and the great erect tail slice through the dark
i wonder how much he at that depth the old man thought
hi eye is huge and a hors with much less eye can see in the dark
onc i could see quit well in the dark
not in the absolut dark
but almost as a cat
the sun and hi steadi movement of hi had uncramp hi left hand now complet and he to shift more of the strain to it and he the of hi back to shift the hurt of the cord a littl
if you not tire fish he said aloud you must be veri strang
he felt veri tire now and he knew the night would come soon and he tri to think of other
he thought of the big to him they were the and he knew that the of new york were the of
thi is the second day now that i do not know the result of the he thought
but i must have confid and i must be worthi of the great who doe all perfectli even with the pain of the bone spur in hi heel
what is a bone spur
he himself
de
we do not have them
can it be as pain as the spur of a fight cock in one heel
i do not think i could endur that or the loss of the eye and of both and continu to fight as the fight do
man is not much besid the great and
still i would rather be that beast down there in the dark of the sea
unless come he said aloud
if come god piti him and me
do you believ the great would stay with a fish as long as i will stay with thi one
he thought
i am sure he would and more sinc he is young and strong
also hi father wa a fisherman
but would the bone spur hurt him too much
i do not know he said aloud
i never had a bone spur
as the sun set he to give himself more confid the time in the tavern at when he had the hand game with the great negro from who wa the man on the
they had gone one day and one night with their on a chalk line on the tabl and their straight up and their tight
each one wa tri to forc the other hand down onto the tabl
there wa much bet and peopl went in and out of the room under the kerosen and he had at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro face
they the everi four after the first eight so that the could sleep
blood came out from under the of both hi and the negro and they each other in the eye and at their and and the went in and out of the room and sat on high against the wall and watch
the were paint bright blue and were of wood and the threw their against them
the negro shadow wa huge and it on the wall as the breez the
the odd would chang back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and for him
then the negro after the rum would tri for a tremend effort and onc he had the old man who wa not an old man then but wa el nearli three off balanc
but the old man had rais hi hand up to dead even again
he wa sure then that he had the negro who wa a fine man and a great athlet beaten
and at daylight when the were that it be a draw and the refere wa shake hi head he had unleash hi effort and forc the hand of the negro down and down until it on the wood
the match had on a morn and end on a morn
mani of the had for a draw becaus they had to go to work on the load of sugar or at the coal compani
otherwis everyon would have it to go to a finish
but he had finish it anyway and befor anyon had to go to work
for a long time after that everyon had him the champion and there had been a return match in the spring
but not much money wa bet and he had won it quit easili sinc he had broken the confid of the negro from in the first match
after that he had a few and then no more
he decid that he could beat anyon if he to badli enough and he decid that it wa bad for hi right hand for fish
he had tri a few practic with hi left hand
but hi left hand had alway been a traitor and would not do what he on it to do and he did not trust it
the sun will bake it out well now he thought
it should not cramp on me again unless it too cold in the night
i wonder what thi night will bring
an airplan over head on it cours to and he watch it shadow up the of fli fish
with so much fli fish there should be dolphin he said and back on the line to see if it wa possibl to gain ani on hi fish
but he could not and it stay at the hard and shiver that break
the boat ahead slowli and he watch the airplan until he could no longer see it
it must be veri strang in an airplan he thought
i wonder what the sea like from that height
they should be abl to see the fish well if they do not fli too high
i would like to fli veri slowli at two hundr high and see the fish from abov
in the turtl i wa in the of the and even at that height i saw much
the dolphin look greener from there and you can see their and their purpl and you can see all of the school as they swim
whi is it that all the fish of the dark current have purpl and usual purpl or
the dolphin green of cours becaus he is realli golden
but when he come to feed truli hungri purpl show on hi side as on a marlin
can it be anger or the greater speed he that them out
just befor it wa dark as they a great island of sargasso weed that and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were make love with someth under a yellow blanket hi small line wa taken by a dolphin
he saw it first when it in the air true gold in the last of the sun and bend and wildli in the air
it again and again in the acrobat of it fear and he work hi way back to the stern and crouch and hold the big line with hi right hand and arm he the dolphin in with hi left hand step on the line each time with hi bare left foot
when the fish wa at the stern plung and cut from side to side in desper the old man over the stern and the gold fish with it purpl over the stern
it were work convuls in quick against the hook and it the bottom of the skiff with it long flat bodi it tail and it head until he club it across the shine golden head until it and wa still
the old man unhook the fish the line with anoth sardin and it over
then he work hi way slowli back to the bow
he wash hi left hand and it on hi trouser
then he the heavi line from hi right hand to hi left and wash hi right hand in the sea while he watch the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord
he at all he said
but watch the movement of the water against hi hand he note that it wa percept
i lash the two togeth across the stern and that will slow him in the night he said
he good for the night and so am i
it would be better to gut the dolphin a littl later to save the blood in the meat he thought
i can do that a littl later and lash the to make a drag at the same time
i had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset
the set of the sun is a difficult time for all fish
he let hi hand dri in the air then the line with it and himself as much as he could and himself to be forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much or more than he did
i learn how to do it he thought
thi part of it anyway
then too rememb he eaten sinc he took the bait and he is huge and need much food
i have eaten the whole bonito
tomorrow i will eat the dolphin
he it
perhap i should eat some of it when i clean it
it will be harder to eat than the bonito
but then noth is easi
how do you feel fish
he aloud
i feel good and my left hand is better and i have food for a night and a day
pull the boat fish
he did not truli feel good becaus the pain from the cord across hi back had almost pain and gone into a dull that he
but i have had wors than that he thought
my hand is onli cut a littl and the cramp is gone from the other
my are all right
also now i have on him in the question of susten
it wa dark now as it becom dark quickli after the sun in
he lay against the worn wood of the bow and all that he could
the first were out
he did not know the name of but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all hi distant
the fish is my friend too he said aloud
i have never seen or of such a fish
but i must kill him
i am glad we do not have to tri to kill the
imagin if each day a man must tri to kill the moon he thought
the moon away
but imagin if a man each day should have to tri to kill the sun
we were born lucki he thought
then he wa sorri for the great fish that had noth to eat and hi determin to kill him never relax in hi sorrow for him
how mani peopl will he feed he thought
but are they worthi to eat him
no of cours not
there is no one worthi of eat him from the manner of hi behaviour and hi great digniti
i do not understand these he thought
but it is good that we do not have to tri to kill the sun or the moon or the
it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true
now he thought i must think about the drag
it it and it
i may lose so much line that i will lose him if he hi effort and the drag made by the is in place and the boat all her light
her light both our suffer but it is my safeti sinc he great speed that he never yet employ
no matter what i must gut the dolphin so he doe not spoil and eat some of him to be strong
now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steadi befor i move back to the stern to do the work and make the decis
in the i can see how he and if he ani
the are a good trick but it the time to play for safeti
he is much fish still and i saw that the hook wa in the corner of hi mouth and he kept hi mouth tight shut
the punish of the hook is noth
the punish of hunger and that he is against someth that he doe not comprehend is everyth
rest now old man and let him work until your next duti come
he for what he to be two
the moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of the time
nor wa he realli rest except compar
he wa still bear the pull of the fish across hi but he hi left hand on the gunwal of the bow and more and more of the resist to the fish to the skiff itself
how simpl it would be if i could make the line fast he thought
but with one small lurch he could break it
i must cushion the pull of the line with my bodi and at all time be readi to give line with both
but you have not slept yet old man he said aloud
it is half a day and a night and now anoth day and you have not slept
you must devis a way so that you sleep a littl if he is quiet and steadi
if you do not sleep you might becom unclear in the head
i clear enough in the head he thought
too clear
i am as clear as the that are my
still i must sleep
they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sometim on certain day when there is no current and a flat calm
but rememb to sleep he thought
make yourself do it and devis some simpl and sure way about the
now go back and prepar the dolphin
it is too danger to rig the as a drag if you must sleep
i could go without sleep he told himself
but it would be too danger
he to work hi way back to the stern on hi and be care not to jerk against the fish
he may be half asleep himself he thought
but i do not want him to rest
he must pull until he
back in the stern he turn so that hi left hand the strain of the line across hi and drew hi knife from it sheath with hi right hand
the were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearli and he the blade of hi knife into hi head and drew him out from under the stern
he put one of hi on the fish and slit him quickli from the vent up to the tip of hi lower jaw
then he put hi knife down and him with hi right hand scoop him clean and the clear
he felt the maw heavi and slipperi in hi and he slit it open
there were two fli fish insid
they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and the and the over the stern
they sank leav a trail of phosphoresc in the water
the dolphin wa cold and a leprou now in the starlight and the old man skin one side of him while he hi right foot on the fish head
then he turn him over and skin the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail
he slid the carcass overboard and to see if there wa ani swirl in the water
but there wa onli the light of it slow descent
he turn then and the two fli fish insid the two of fish and hi knife back in it sheath he work hi way slowli back to the bow
hi back wa bent with the weight of the line across it and he carri the fish in hi right hand
back in the bow he laid the two of fish out on the wood with the fli fish besid them
after that he settl the line across hi in a new place and it again with hi left hand rest on the gunwal
then he over the side and wash the fli fish in the water the speed of the water against hi hand
hi hand wa phosphoresc from skin the fish and he watch the flow of the water against it
the flow wa less strong and as he rub the side of hi hand against the plank of the skiff of phosphoru off and slowli astern
he is tire or he is rest the old man said
now let me get through the eat of thi dolphin and get some rest and a littl sleep
under the and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin and one of the fli fish and with it head cut off
what an excel fish dolphin is to eat he said
and what a miser fish raw
i will never go in a boat again without salt or lime
if i had brain i would have splash water on the bow all day and dri it would have made salt he thought
but then i did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset
still it wa a lack of prepar
but i have it all well and i am not
the sky wa cloud over to the east and one after anoth the he knew were gone
it now as though he were move into a great canyon of and the wind had
there will be bad weather in three or four day he said
but not tonight and not tomorrow
rig now to get some sleep old man while the fish is calm and steadi
he the line tight in hi right hand and then hi thigh against hi right hand as he all hi weight against the wood of the bow
then he the line a littl lower on hi and brace hi left hand on it
my right hand can hold it as long as it is brace he thought
if it in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goe out
it is hard on the right hand
but he is use to punish
even if i sleep twenti or a half an hour it is good
he lay forward cramp himself against the line with all of hi bodi all hi weight onto hi right hand and he wa asleep
he did not dream of the but instead of a vast school of that for eight or ten and it wa in the time of their mate and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they
then he that he wa in the villag on hi bed and there wa a norther and he wa veri cold and hi right arm wa asleep becaus hi head had on it instead of a pillow
after that he to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the come down onto it in the earli dark and then the other came and he hi chin on the wood of the where the ship lay anchor with the even breez and he to see if there would be more and he wa happi
the moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish on steadili and the boat into the tunnel of
he woke with the jerk of hi right fist come up against hi face and the line burn out through hi right hand
he had no feel of hi left hand but he all he could with hi right and the line rush out
final hi left hand found the line and he back against the line and now it burn hi back and hi left hand and hi left hand wa take all the strain and cut badli
he back at the of line and they were feed smoothli
just then the fish make a great of the ocean and then a heavi fall
then he again and again and the boat wa go fast although line wa still race out and the old man wa rais the strain to break point and rais it to break point again and again
he had been down tight onto the bow and hi face wa in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move
thi is what we for he thought
so now let us take it
make him pay for the line he thought
make him pay for it
he could not see the fish but onli the break of the ocean and the heavi splash as he fell
the speed of the line wa cut hi badli but he had alway known thi would happen and he tri to keep the cut across the and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the
if the boy wa here he would wet the of line he thought
ye
if the boy were here
if the boy were here
the line went out and out and out but it wa now and he wa make the fish earn each inch of it
now he got hi head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that hi cheek had crush
then he wa on hi and then he rose slowli to hi
he wa line but more slowli all the time
he work back to where he could feel with hi foot the of line that he could not see
there wa plenti of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water
ye he thought
and now he more than a dozen time and fill the along hi back with air and he can not go down deep to die where i can not bring him up
he will start circl soon and then i must work on him
i wonder what him so suddenli
could it have been hunger that made him desper or wa he frighten by someth in the night
mayb he suddenli felt fear
but he wa such a calm strong fish and he so fearless and so confid
it is strang
you better be fearless and confid yourself old man he said
you hold him again but you can not get line
but soon he to circl
the old man him with hi left hand and hi now and down and scoop up water in hi right hand to get the crush dolphin flesh off of hi face
he wa afraid that it might nauseat him and he would vomit and lose hi strength
when hi face wa he wash hi right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watch the first light come befor the sunris
he head almost east he thought
that he is tire and go with the current
soon he will have to circl
then our true work
after he that hi right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and at it
it is not bad he said
and pain doe not matter to a man
he took hold of the line care so that it did not fit into ani of the fresh line and hi weight so that he could put hi left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff
you did not do so badli for someth worthless he said to hi left hand
but there wa a moment when i could not find you
whi wa i not born with two good
he thought
perhap it wa my fault in not train that one properli
but god he had enough to learn
he did not do so badli in the night though and he onli cramp onc
if he again let the line cut him off
when he thought that he knew that he wa not be and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin
but i ca he told himself
it is better to be than to lose your strength from nausea
and i know i can not keep it if i eat it sinc my face wa in it
i will keep it for an emerg until it goe bad
but it is too late to tri for strength now through nourish
you stupid he told himself
eat the other fli fish
it wa there and readi and he pick it up with hi left hand and ate it the care and eat all of it down to the tail
it more nourish than almost ani fish he thought
at least the kind of strength that i need
now i have done what i can he thought
let him begin to circl and let the fight come
the sun wa rise for the third time sinc he had put to sea when the fish to circl
he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish wa circl
it wa too earli for that
he just felt a faint of the pressur of the line and he to pull on it gentli with hi right hand
it as alway but just when he the point where it would break line to come in
he slip hi and head from under the line and to pull in line steadili and gentli
he use both of hi in a swing motion and tri to do the as much as he could with hi bodi and hi
hi old and with the swing of the
it is a veri big circl he said
but he is circl
then the line would not come in ani more and he it until he saw the from it in the sun
then it out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingli back into the dark water
he is make the far part of hi circl now he said
i must hold all i can he thought
the strain will shorten hi circl each time
perhap in an hour i will see him
now i must convinc him and then i must kill him
but the fish kept on circl slowli and the old man wa wet with sweat and tire deep into hi two later
but the were much shorter now and from the way the line he could tell the fish had risen steadili while he swam
for an hour the old man had been see black befor hi and the sweat salt hi and salt the cut over hi eye and on hi forehead
he wa not afraid of the black
they were normal at the tension that he wa on the line
twice though he had felt faint and dizzi and that had worri him
i could not fail myself and die on a fish like thi he said
now that i have him come so beauti god help me endur
i say a hundr our and a hundr hail
but i can not say them now
consid them said he thought
i say them later
just then he felt a sudden bang and on the line he with hi two
it wa sharp and and heavi
he is the wire leader with hi spear he thought
that wa bound to come
he had to do that
it may make him jump though and i would rather he stay circl now
the were necessari for him to take air
but after that each one can widen the open of the hook wound and he can throw the hook
do jump fish he said
do jump
the fish hit the wire sever time more and each time he shook hi head the old man gave up a littl line
i must hold hi pain where it is he thought
mine doe not matter
i can control mine
but hi pain could drive him mad
after a while the fish stop beat at the wire and circl slowli again
the old man wa gain line steadili now
but he felt faint again
he some sea water with hi left hand and put it on hi head
then he put more on and rub the back of hi neck
i have no he said
he be up soon and i can last
you have to last
do even speak of it
he against the bow and for a moment slip the line over hi back again
i rest now while he goe out on the circl and then stand up and work on him when he come in he decid
it wa a great temptat to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circl by himself without ani line
but when the strain the fish had turn to come toward the boat the old man rose to hi and the and the weav that brought in all the line he
i than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is rise
but that will be good to take him in with
i need that badli
i rest on the next turn as he goe out he said
i feel much better
then in two or three turn more i will have him
hi straw hat wa far on the back of hi head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn
you work now fish he thought
i take you at the turn
the sea had risen consider
but it wa a breez and he had to have it to get home
i just steer south and west he said
a man is never lost at sea and it is a long island
it wa on the third turn that he saw the fish first
he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believ it length
no he said
he ca be that big
but he wa that big and at the end of thi circl he came to the surfac onli thirti away and the man saw hi tail out of water
it wa higher than a big scyth blade and a veri pale lavend abov the dark blue water
it back and as the fish swam just below the surfac the old man could see hi huge bulk and the purpl that band him
hi dorsal fin wa down and hi huge were spread wide
on thi circl the old man could see the fish eye and the two gray suck fish that swam around him
sometim they attach themselv to him
sometim they off
sometim they would swim easili in hi shadow
they were each over three long and when they swam fast they their whole like
the old man wa sweat now but from someth els besid the sun
on each calm placid turn the fish made he wa gain line and he wa sure that in two turn more he would have a chanc to get the harpoon in
but i must get him close close close he thought
i must tri for the head
i must get the heart
be calm and strong old man he said
on the next circl the fish back wa out but he wa a littl too far from the boat
on the next circl he wa still too far away but he wa higher out of water and the old man wa sure that by gain some more line he could have him alongsid
he had hi harpoon long befor and it coil of light rope wa in a round basket and the end wa made fast to the bitt in the bow
the fish wa come in on hi circl now calm and beauti look and onli hi great tail move
the old man on him all that he could to bring him closer
for just a moment the fish turn a littl on hi side
then he himself and anoth circl
i him the old man said
i him then
he felt faint again now but he on the great fish all the strain that he could
i him he thought
mayb thi time i can get him over
pull he thought
hold up
last for me head
last for me
you never went
thi time i pull him over
but when he put all of hi effort on start it well out befor the fish came alongsid and with all hi strength the fish part way over and then himself and swam away
fish the old man said
fish you are go to have to die anyway
do you have to kill me too
that way noth is accomplish he thought
hi mouth wa too dri to speak but he could not reach for the water now
i must get him alongsid thi time he thought
i am not good for mani more turn
ye you are he told himself
you good for ever
on the next turn he nearli had him
but again the fish himself and swam slowli away
you are kill me fish the old man thought
but you have a right to
never have i seen a greater or more beauti or a calmer or more nobl thing than you brother
come on and kill me
i do not care who who
now you are get confus in the head he thought
you must keep your head clear
keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man
or a fish he thought
clear up head he said in a voic he could hardli hear
clear up
twice more it wa the same on the turn
i do not know the old man thought
he had been on the point of feel himself go each time
i do not know
but i will tri it onc more
he tri it onc more and he felt himself go when he turn the fish
the fish himself and swam off again slowli with the great tail weav in the air
i tri it again the old man although hi were mushi now and he could onli see well in
he tri it again and it wa the same
so he thought and he felt himself go befor he i will tri it onc again
he took all hi pain and what wa left of hi strength and hi long gone pride and he put it against the fish agoni and the fish came over onto hi side and swam gentli on hi side hi bill almost touch the plank of the skiff and to pass the boat long deep wide silver and bar with purpl and intermin in the water
the old man the line and put hi foot on it and the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all hi strength and more strength he had just into the fish side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitud of the man chest
he felt the iron go in and he on it and drove it further and then all hi weight after it
then the fish came aliv with hi death in him and rose high out of the water show all hi great length and width and all hi power and hi beauti
he to in the air abov the old man in the skiff
then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff
the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well
but he the harpoon line and let it run slowli through hi raw and when he could see he saw the fish wa on hi back with hi silver belli up
the shaft of the harpoon wa project at an angl from the fish shoulder and the sea wa with the red of the blood from hi heart
first it wa dark as a shoal in the blue water that wa more than a mile deep
then it spread like a cloud
the fish wa silveri and still and with the
the old man care in the glimps of vision that he had
then he took two turn of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid hi head on hi
keep my head clear he said against the wood of the bow
i am a tire old man
but i have thi fish which is my brother and now i must do the slave work
now i must prepar the and the rope to lash him alongsid he thought
even if we were two and her to load him and her out thi skiff would never hold him
i must prepar everyth then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home
he to pull the fish in to have him alongsid so that he could pass a line through hi and out hi mouth and make hi head fast alongsid the bow
i want to see him he thought and to touch and to feel him
he is my fortun he thought
but that is not whi i wish to feel him
i think i felt hi heart he thought
when i on the harpoon shaft the second time
bring him in now and make him fast and get the noos around hi tail and anoth around hi middl to bind him to the skiff
get to work old man he said
he took a veri small drink of the water
there is veri much slave work to be done now that the fight is over
he up at the sky and then out to hi fish
he at the sun care
it is not much more than noon he thought
and the trade wind is rise
the all mean noth now
the boy and i will splice them when we are home
come on fish he said
but the fish did not come
instead he lay there now in the and the old man the skiff up onto him
when he wa even with him and had the fish head against the bow he could not believ hi size
but he unti the harpoon rope from the bitt it through the fish and out hi made a turn around hi sword then the rope through the other gill made anoth turn around the bill and knot the doubl rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow
he cut the rope then and went astern to noos the tail
the fish had turn silver from hi origin purpl and silver and the the same pale violet colour as hi tail
they were than a man hand with hi spread and the fish eye as detach as the in a periscop or as a saint in a process
it wa the onli way to kill him the old man said
he wa feel better sinc the water and he knew he would not go away and hi head wa clear
he over fifteen hundr the way he is he thought
mayb much more
if he out of that at thirti a pound
i need a pencil for that he said
my head is not that clear
but i think the great would be of me today
i had no bone
but the and the back hurt truli
i wonder what a bone spur is he thought
mayb we have them without know of it
he made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middl thwart
he wa so big it wa like a much bigger skiff alongsid
he cut a piec of line and tie the fish lower jaw against hi bill so hi mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanli as possibl
then he step the mast and with the stick that wa hi gaff and with hi boom the sail drew the boat to move and half lie in the stern he sail
he did not need a compass to tell him where wa
he onli the feel of the trade wind and the draw of the sail
i better put a small line out with a spoon on it and tri and get someth to eat and drink for the moistur
but he could not find a spoon and hi were rotten
so he hook a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they and shook it so that the small that were in it fell onto the plank of the skiff
there were more than a dozen of them and they and like sand
the old man pinch their off with hi thumb and forefing and ate them up the and the
they were veri tini but he knew they were nourish and they tast good
the old man still had two of water in the bottl and he use half of one after he had eaten the
the skiff wa sail well consid the and he with the tiller under hi arm
he could see the fish and he had onli to look at hi and feel hi back against the stern to know that thi had truli and wa not a dream
at one time when he wa feel so badli toward the end he had thought perhap it wa a dream
then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and motionless in the sky befor he fell he wa sure there wa some great strang and he could not believ it
then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever
now he knew there wa the fish and hi and back were no dream
the cure quickli he thought
i them clean and the salt water will heal them
the dark water of the true gulf is the healer that there is
all i must do is keep the head clear
the have done their work and we sail well
with hi mouth shut and hi tail straight up and down we sail like
then hi head to becom a littl unclear and he thought is he me in or am i him in
if i were tow him behind there would be no question
nor if the fish were in the skiff with all digniti gone there would be no question either
but they were sail togeth side by side and the old man thought let him bring me in if it him
i am onli better than him through trickeri and he meant me no harm
they sail well and the old man soak hi in the salt water and tri to keep hi head clear
there were high cumulu and enough cirru abov them so that the old man knew the breez would last all night
the old man at the fish constantli to make sure it wa true
it wa an hour befor the first shark hit him
the shark wa not an accid
he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settl and dispers in the mile deep sea
he had come up so fast and absolut without caution that he broke the surfac of the blue water and wa in the sun
then he fell back into the sea and pick up the scent and swim on the cours the skiff and the fish had taken
sometim he lost the scent
but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he swam fast and hard on the cours
he wa a veri big mako shark built to swim as fast as the fish in the sea and everyth about him wa beauti except hi
hi back wa as blue as a sword fish and hi belli wa silver and hi hide wa smooth and handsom
he wa built as a sword fish except for hi huge which were tight shut now as he swam fast just under the surfac with hi high dorsal fin through the water without waver
insid the close doubl lip of hi all of hi eight of teeth were inward
they were not the ordinari teeth of most
they were shape like a when they are crisp like
they were nearli as long as the of the old man and they had cut on both side
thi wa a fish built to feed on all the in the sea that were so fast and strong and well arm that they had no other enemi
now he up as he smell the scent and hi blue dorsal fin cut the water
when the old man saw him come he knew that thi wa a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactli what he wish
he prepar the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watch the shark come on
the rope wa short as it what he had cut away to lash the fish
the old man head wa clear and good now and he wa full of resolut but he had littl hope
it wa too good to last he thought
he took one look at the great fish as he watch the shark close in
it might as well have been a dream he thought
i can not keep him from me but mayb i can get him
he thought
bad luck to your mother
the shark close fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw hi mouth open and hi strang and the chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just abov the tail
the shark head wa out of water and hi back wa come out and the old man could hear the nois of skin and flesh rip on the big fish when he the harpoon down onto the shark head at a spot where the line between hi with the line that ran straight back from hi nose
there were no such
there wa onli the heavi sharp blue head and the big and the thrust
but that wa the locat of the brain and the old man hit it
he hit it with hi blood mush drive a good harpoon with all hi strength
he hit it without hope but with resolut and complet malign
the shark swung over and the old man saw hi eye wa not aliv and then he swung over onc again wrap himself in two of the rope
the old man knew that he wa dead but the shark would not accept it
then on hi back with hi tail and hi the shark over the water as a doe
the water wa white where hi tail beat it and of hi bodi wa clear abov the water when the rope came taut and then snap
the shark lay quietli for a littl while on the surfac and the old man watch him
then he went down veri slowli
he took about forti the old man said aloud
he took my harpoon too and all the rope he thought and now my fish again and there will be
he did not like to look at the fish sinc he had been
when the fish had been hit it wa as though he himself were hit
but i the shark that hit my fish he thought
and he wa the biggest that i have ever seen
and god that i have seen big
it wa too good to last he thought
i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never hook the fish and wa alon in bed on the
but man is not made for defeat he said
a man can be but not
i am sorri that i the fish though he thought
now the bad time is come and i do not even have the harpoon
the is cruel and abl and strong and intellig
but i wa more intellig that he wa
perhap not he thought
perhap i wa onli better arm
do think old man he said aloud
sail on thi cours and take it when it come
but i must think he thought
becaus it is all i have left
that and basebal
i wonder how the great would have the way i hit him in the brain
it wa no great thing he thought
ani man could do it
but do you think my were as great a handicap as the bone
i can not know
i never had anyth wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when i step on him when swim and the lower leg and made the unbear pain
think about someth cheer old man he said
everi minut now you are closer to home
you sail lighter for the loss of forti
he knew quit well the pattern of what could happen when he the inner part of the current
but there wa noth to be done now
ye there is he said aloud
i can lash my knife to the butt of one of the
so he did that with the tiller under hi arm and the sheet of the sail under hi foot
now he said
i am still an old man
but i am not unarm
the breez wa fresh now and he sail on well
he watch onli the forward part of the fish and some of hi hope return
it is silli not to hope he thought
besid i believ it is a sin
do not think about sin he thought
there are enough now without sin
also i have no understand of it
i have no understand of it and i am not sure that i believ in it
perhap it wa a sin to kill the fish
i suppos it wa even though i did it to keep me aliv and feed mani peopl
but then everyth is a sin
do not think about sin
it is much too late for that and there are peopl who are to do it
let them think about it
you were born to be a fisherman as the fish wa born to be a fish
san pedro wa a fisherman as wa the father of the great
but he to think about all that he wa involv in and sinc there wa noth to read and he did not have a radio he thought much and he kept on think about sin
you did not kill the fish onli to keep aliv and to sell for food he thought
you him for pride and becaus you are a fisherman
you him when he wa aliv and you him after
it you love him it is not a sin to kill him
or is it more
you think too much old man he said aloud
but you kill the he thought
he on the live fish as you do
he is not a scaveng nor just a move appetit as some are
he is beauti and nobl and no fear of anyth
i him in the old man said aloud
and i him well
besid he thought everyth everyth els in some way
fish me exactli as it me aliv
the boy me aliv he thought
i must not deceiv myself too much
he over the side and loos a piec of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him
he it and note it qualiti and it good tast
it wa firm and juici like meat but it wa not red
there wa no stringi in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market
but there wa no way to keep it scent out of the water and the old man knew that a veri bad time wa come
the breez wa steadi
it had back a littl further into the and he knew that meant that it would not fall off
the old man ahead of him but he could see no nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of ani ship
there were onli the fli fish that went up from hi bow sail away to either side and the yellow of
he could not even see a bird
he had sail for two rest in the stern and sometim a bit of the meat from the marlin tri to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two
he said aloud
there is no translat for thi word and perhap it is just a nois such as a man might make involuntarili feel the nail go through hi and into the wood
he said aloud
he had seen the second fin now come up behind the first and had them as by the brown triangular fin and the sweep of the tail
they had the scent and were excit and in the stupid of their great hunger they were lose and find the scent in their excit
but they were all the time
the old man made the sheet fast and the tiller
then he took up the oar with the knife to it
he it as lightli as he could becaus hi at the pain
then he and close them on it lightli to loosen them
he close them firmli so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watch the come
he could see their wide now and their wide pector
they were hate bad smell as well as and when they were hungri they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat
it wa these that would cut the and off when the were asleep on the surfac and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungri even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him
the old man said

come on
they came
but they did not come as the mako had come
one turn and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he and on the fish
the other watch the old man with hi slit yellow and then came in fast with hi half circl of wide to hit the fish where he had alreadi been bitten
the line clearli on the top of hi brown head and back where the brain the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the junctur it and drove it in again into the yellow
the shark let go of the fish and slid down what he had taken as he
the skiff wa still shake with the destruct the other shark wa do to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadsid and bring the shark out from under
when he saw the shark he over the side and at him
he hit onli meat and the hide wa set hard and he bare got the knife in
the blow hurt not onli hi but hi shoulder too
but the shark came up fast with hi head out and the old man hit him squar in the center of hi head as hi nose came out of water and lay against the fish
the old man the blade and the shark exactli in the same spot again
he still hung to the fish with hi hook and the old man him in hi left eye
the shark still hung there
no
the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebra and the brain
it wa an easi shot now and he felt the cartilag sever
the old man revers the oar and put the blade between the shark to open them
he twist the blade and as the shark slid loos he said go on
slide down a mile deep
go see your friend or mayb it your mother
the old man the blade of hi knife and laid down the oar
then he found the sheet and the sail fill and he brought the skiff onto her cours
they must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat he said aloud
i wish it were a dream and that i had never hook him
sorri about it fish
it everyth wrong
he stop and he did not want to look at the fish now
drain of blood and awash he the colour of the silver back of a mirror and hi still
i should have gone out so far fish he said
neither for you nor for me
i sorri fish
now he said to himself
look to the on the knife and see if it been cut
then get your hand in order becaus there still is more to come
i wish i had a stone for the knife the old man said after he had check the on the oar butt
i should have brought a stone
you should have brought mani he thought
but you did not bring them old man
now is no time to think of what you do not have
think of what you can do with what there is
you give me much good counsel he said aloud
i tire of it
he the tiller under hi arm and soak both hi in the water as the skiff drove forward
god how much that last one took he said
but she much lighter now
he did not want to think of the of the fish
he knew that each of the of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all as wide as a highway through the sea
he wa a fish to keep a man all winter he thought
do think of that
just rest and tri to get your in shape to defend what is left of him
the blood smell from my noth now with all that scent in the water
besid they do not bleed much
there is noth cut that anyth
the bleed may keep the left from cramp
what can i think of now
he thought
noth
i must think of noth and wait for the next
i wish it had realli been a dream he thought
but who
it might have turn out well
the next shark that came wa a singl
he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it
the old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into hi brain
but the shark backward as he roll and the knife blade snap
the old man settl himself to steer
he did not even watch the big shark sink slowli in the water show first then small then tini
that alway fascin the old man
but he did not even watch it now
i have the gaff now he said
but it will do no good
i have the two and the tiller and the short club
now they have beaten me he thought
i am too old to club to death
but i will tri it as long as i have the and the short club and the tiller
he put hi in the water again to soak them
it wa get late in the afternoon and he saw noth but the sea and the sky
there wa more wind in the sky than there had been and soon he hope that he would see land
you tire old man he said
you tire insid
the did not hit him again until just befor sunset
the old man saw the brown come along the wide trail the fish must make in the water
they were not even quarter on the scent
they were head straight for the skiff swim side by side
he the tiller made the sheet fast and under the stern for the club
it wa an oar handl from a broken oar saw off to about two and a half in length
he could onli use it effect with one hand becaus of the grip of the handl and he took good hold of it with hi right hand hi hand on it as he watch the come
they were both
i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head he thought
the two close togeth and as he saw the one nearest him open hi and sink them into the silver side of the fish he rais the club high and brought it down heavi and onto the top of the shark broad head
he felt the rubberi solid as the club came down
but he felt the rigid of bone too and he struck the shark onc more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish
the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with hi wide
the old man could see of the meat of the fish white from the corner of hi as he the fish and close hi
he swung at him and hit onli the head and the shark at him and wrench the meat loos
the old man swung the club down on him again as he slip away to swallow and hit onli the heavi solid
come on the old man said
come in again
the shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut hi
he hit him solidli and from as high up as he could rais the club
thi time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loos sluggishli and slid down from the fish
the old man watch for him to come again but neither shark
then he saw one on the surfac swim in
he did not see the fin of the other
i could not expect to kill them he thought
i could have in my time
but i have hurt them both badli and neither one can feel veri good
if i could have use a bat with two i could have the first one sure
even now he thought
he did not want to look at the fish
he knew that half of him had been
the sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the
it will be dark soon he said
then i should see the glow of
if i am too far to the eastward i will see the of one of the new
i can not be too far out now he thought
i hope no one been too worri
there is onli the boy to worri of cours
but i am sure he would have confid
mani of the older will worri
mani too he thought
i live in a good town
he could not talk to the fish becaus the fish had been ruin too badli
then someth came into hi head
half fish he said
fish that you were
i am sorri that i went too far out
i ruin us both
but we have mani you and i and ruin mani
how mani did you ever kill old fish
you do not have that spear on your head for noth
he to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swim free
i should have chop the bill off to fight them with he thought
but there wa no hatchet and then there wa no knife
but if i had and could have it to an oar butt what a weapon
then we might have fought them togeth
what will you do now if they come in the night
what can you do
fight them he said
i fight them until i die
but in the dark now and no glow show and no and onli the wind and the steadi pull of the sail he felt that perhap he wa alreadi dead
he put hi two togeth and felt the
they were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simpli open and them
he hi back against the stern and knew he wa not dead
hi told him
i have all those i if i caught the fish he thought
but i am too tire to say them now
i better get the sack and put it over my
he lay in the stern and and watch for the glow to come in the sky
i have half of him he thought
mayb i have the luck to bring the forward half in
i should have some luck
no he said
you your luck when you went too far outsid
do be silli he said aloud
and keep awak and steer
you may have much luck yet
i like to buy some if there ani place they sell it he said
what could i buy it with
he himself
could i buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad
you might he said
you tri to buy it with day at sea
they nearli sold it to you too
i must not think nonsens he thought
luck is a thing that come in mani and who can recogn her
i would take some though in ani form and pay what they
i wish i could see the glow from the he thought
i wish too mani
but that is the thing i wish for now
he tri to settl more comfort to steer and from hi pain he knew he wa not dead
he saw the reflect glare of the of the citi at what must have been around ten at night
they were onli percept at first as the light is in the sky befor the moon
then they were steadi to see across the ocean which wa rough now with the increas breez
he insid of the glow and he thought that now soon he must hit the edg of the stream
now it is over he thought
they will probabl hit me again
but what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon
he wa stiff and sore now and hi wound and all of the strain of hi bodi hurt with the cold of the night
i hope i do not have to fight again he thought
i hope so much i do not have to fight again
but by midnight he fought and thi time he knew the fight wa useless
they came in a pack and he could onli see the in the water that their made and their phosphoresc as they threw themselv on the fish
he club at and the chop and the shake of the skiff as they took hold below
he club desper at what he could onli feel and hear and he felt someth seiz the club and it wa gone
he the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chop with it hold it in both and drive it down again and again
but they were up to the bow now and drive in one after the other and togeth tear off the of meat that glow below the sea as they turn to come onc more
one came final against the head itself and he knew that it wa over
he swung the tiller across the shark head where the were caught in the heavi of the fish head which would not tear
he swung it onc and twice and again
he the tiller break and he lung at the shark with the butt
he felt it go in and know it wa sharp he drove it in again
the shark let go and roll away
that wa the last shark of the pack that came
there wa noth more for them to eat
the old man could hardli breath now and he felt a strang tast in hi mouth
it wa copperi and sweet and he wa afraid of it for a moment
but there wa not much of it
he spat into the ocean and said eat that
and make a dream you a man
he knew he wa beaten now final and without remedi and he went back to the stern and found the jag end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer
he settl the sack around hi and put the skiff on her cours
he sail lightli now and he had no nor ani of ani kind
he wa past everyth now and he sail the skiff to make hi home port as well and as intellig as he could
in the night hit the carcass as someon might pick up from the tabl
the old man no attent to them and did not pay ani attent to anyth except steer
he onli how lightli and how well the skiff sail now there wa no great weight besid her
she good he thought
she is sound and not in ani way except for the tiller
that is easili
he could feel he wa insid the current now and he could see the of the beach along the shore
he knew where he wa now and it wa noth to get home
the wind is our friend anyway he thought
then he ad sometim
and the great sea with our and our
and bed he thought
bed is my friend
just bed he thought
bed will be a great thing
it is easi when you are beaten he thought
i never knew how easi it wa
and what beat you he thought
noth he said aloud
i went out too far
when he sail into the littl harbour the of the terrac were out and he knew everyon wa in bed
the breez had risen steadili and wa blow strongli now
it wa quiet in the harbour though and he sail up onto the littl patch of shingl below the
there wa no one to help him so he the boat up as far as he could
then he step out and made her fast to a rock
he the mast and the sail and tie it
then he shoulder the mast and to climb
it wa then he knew the depth of hi tired
he stop for a moment and back and saw in the reflect from the street light the great tail of the fish stand up well behind the skiff stern
he saw the white nake line of hi backbon and the dark mass of the head with the project bill and all the naked between
he to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across hi shoulder
he tri to get up
but it wa too difficult and he sat there with the mast on hi shoulder and at the road
a cat on the far side go about it busi and the old man watch it
then he just watch the road
final he put the mast down and stood up
he pick the mast up and put it on hi shoulder and up the road
he had to sit down five time befor he hi shack
insid the shack he the mast against the wall
in the dark he found a water bottl and took a drink
then he lay down on the bed

he wa asleep when the boy in the door in the morn
